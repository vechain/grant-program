### Overview

The MOTODB Protocol is a Global, Decentralized Car Industry Blockchain that will enable the Connected Cars Paradigm by putting the Driver at the Centre and Empower them to share their user-generated Data in return for real rewards. 
We are passionate and strong advocates of Car Data Privacy and also believe that the Driver should benefit from the data they generate. 
We are working with a wide variety of Car Ecosystem Partners to enable this Vision. 
The MOTODB Protocol is a Driver-powered Network that aims to decentralize Car Data and deliver benefits to Car Drivers both from a data privacy perspective and monetization benefits. 
Car data that is accessible on a Public blockchain enables to building of various distributed applications and crypto protocols on top of of this data e.g. decentralized insurance, car finance, prescriptive/ predictive maintenance ML models, decentralized car pooling/ ride sharing and car resale. 
The MOTODB Protocol consists of Hardware/ Devices called CarMiners, a Driver App and a Decentralized Data marketplace for Cars and vehicles. 
Our user go-to-market strategy and user-acquisition strategies are based on partnerships with 2 of the top, global companies in the mobility space that are also community-driven. 
We aim to enable 10 million Cars in the first 2 years with the MOTODB Protocol and enable the collection of Car data in a decentralized, distributed and trustless manner.

We are a team of 2 Masters in Tech. (M.Tech.) Engineers from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras and 1 MBA from INSEAD, France. 
Our backgrounds are in IoT, Mechanical Engineering, Data Science, Chemical Engineering, Systems Control, sensor integration and software development, GSM-based Communications systems development and Business and Finance.

MOTODB is both a Hardware based Data aggregator protocol, and also has a Mobile Application to access Telematics data (similar to ZenDrive, but with crypto-economic incentives) from Cars and Drivers. 
The current working prototype has a Basic MOTODB CarMiner device, Data storage on Decentralized cloud and Data summary (trip wise metrics like average & top speed, engine health summary) stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

We are also building more decentralized protocols leveraging Tokenized cars (NFTs) and use of Car Data to reimagine the entire vehicle data ecosystem. 
Some major Dapps we are working on include Decentralized Car Insurance Protocol and a Used Car Financing Protocol and also building Car/ Vehicle DeFi Derivatives Protocol based on pools of Insurance bonds, etc.

We see huge potential to leverage Car data to build Decentralized Car Pooling Apps, Car DeFi; which is universal and beneficial to anyone across the globe. 
It is our intent to make Car NFTs open to any blockchain and enable anyone from any ecosystem to use this data for building their own protocols.

The Vechain Protocol is the starting point for us as it allows us to bridge NFTs, Car Data and Car DeFi Securities across multiple chains. 
We plan to port our MOTODB tokens to Vechain and also store telemetry data on the Vechain blockchain. 
We have a dual token system and anyone who wants to access this data would have to burn MOTODB tokens and access Car data through a Data Credits mechanism. 
We are also leveraging a burn-and-mint mechanism in our tokenomics design.

Our Basic MOTODB CarMiner is ready and we are currently in testing phase with this device. 
We have a working prototype installed in several Cars in India and the USA and their data including individual trips can be viewed on our Data Explorer. 
Our first lot of 10,000 MOTODB CarMiner Devices is already in manufacturing phase and we will be testing these devices over the next 2 months. 
Our pre-orders for the Basic MOTODB CarMiner will start on 15th Jan with a shipping date of 26 Feb 2022. 
We are also working on the design of an Advanced MOTODB CarMiner which will have advanced Computing capabilities along with Artificial Intelligence capabilities built in. 
The Advanced MOTODB CarMiner will be ready for shipping by May-2022 and will have the ability to integrate Cameras (Dash Cams, inward and outward facing) and LIDAR/ RADAR sensors, in addition to the OBD device, into the CarMiner.

Our Customer Acquisition process for MOTODB CarMiner is currently through a Partnership agreement that we are in the process of finalizing with the World’s largest Community Driven Car Pooling App, BlaBlaCar. 
They have 100 million Cars on the road and we are aiming to partner with them to reach their Customer base with our CarMiners. 
The resultant combination would be the owners of the World’s largest pool of Car Data, along with incentivizing and rewarding Car Drivers and Passengers. 
We are also focused on organic adoption of our CarMiners through various channels including Direct-to-Consumer and other B2B channels like global Car Dealerships.
