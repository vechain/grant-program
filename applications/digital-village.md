### Overview

<br />

Digital Village (DV) is a recomposition of social media, gaming and e-commerce. DV is the first real-time Sustainable Multiplayer Metaverse connected to its Social Marketplace, which merges the physical and digital world with its own social blockchain technology UI, Village Protocol, and allows the real utility of digital assets. DV applies human-centric design principles to create a Metaverse through the blockchain-based Metaprofiles powered by The Village Protocol Social System, connecting users through the marketplace to the DV MMO, connecting users with physical environments through their digital footprints.
Our global patented Village protocol allows users to visualize and immerse themselves with the blockchain in real-time, charting the movement of the digital footprints of their avatars and the community. Users participate, socialize, and collaborate with fellow users on the Village Protocol, where they influence the fluctuating movement of the protocol impacting the market directly, transparent to the entire community. The Village Protocol allows users to mirror their activities and experiences in the physical world to the digital world utilizing DV coins in real-time from the marketplace into the metaverse through their Metaprofiles of Digital Village.

<br />

Our native token DV Coin (DVC) is a new social incentivizing system, a complete opposite to the "like" button, which fosters negative comparisons on social media. DV coins help support each other for good actions in the real world and Digital Village Metaverse, leading to a large impact through behavioral development. DV Coin is a new social system to build an ecosystem for sustainable action, and users earn their reputation based on efforts. DV coins are a new accounting mechanism like carbon offset with which a business, a government, online communities or an individual can use to transact with someone else to cut or remove a given quantity of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere (instead of planting a tree which will be planted now and will create actual impact in years time with DV Loyalty Points the impact has already been created.The only difference is DV Coin will focus on the overall sustainability of humans and not just on environmental sustainability but also on cultural and social aspects. Users can earn DV coins by completing challenges provided by DV or making mindful choices by supporting local and sustainable businesses, by supporting female entrepreneurship, businesses, and organizations owned by people of color, minorities, or practicing more sustainable lifestyles by taking physical and digital actions to contribute to positive social impact. DVC will also lead to an open, inclusive economy where emerging creative talents focus on their vision and sustainability goals through a peer-curated feedback loop of content, ideas, data, problem-solving, and design thinking approaches.

<br />

To summarize,  Digital Village is building an NFT metaverse platform where brands, governments, artists, and game developers can co-exist and drive sustainable behaviors.

### Ecosystem Fit
* Our platform can help the VeChain ecosystem to launch their eNFTs and build communities around it using our village protocol, find utility for their assets in our metaverse, connect IRL NFTs to digital NFTs and learn how their customers are engaging with their eNFTs to develop sustainable IRL products which can resonate with their customers. Digital Village is a new social media for gen Z and the VeChain ecosystem can embrace the social connections to build new applications on top of the Village protocol social graph.
 
* Digital Village merges digital world with real world by tracing digital footprints of the users and goods. Digital village is currently in discussions with departments of sustainable development in several cities, luxury brands, and museums to take up residence and use Digital village to simulate human behavior for social betterment, tackle climate change, and build better societies. We allow our users to interact with these companies in the metaverse and physical spaces connecting these two different worlds through their digital footprints powered by the social blockchain technology of our platform. Digital Village can help brands envision the future of their brand and accelerate their innovations towards overall sustainability.
