## Project Overview 

- Project: miden
- Team Name: N.A.U. MIDEN LTD
- Payment Address: 0xFE59E858d5999C16A6f60bf521209167Abf6Df15

### Overview

N.A.U. MIDEN LTD is a true zero first Company focusing on sustainability and carbon neutrality through global innovation and use of blockchain technology. Our vision is to reconnect humanity with nature by embracing technology that paves the road towards greener societies.

miden aims in building a platform that will establish the real value of nature preservation and care. Our objectives of creating a sense of responsibility, educating the public and giving the tools to act immediately towards the establishment of greener societies generate a positive feedback loop in improving the sustainability of our actions. 

The first stage of the project will involve the issuance of unique NFT Certificates for trees planted through the platform, acting as proof of activity for individuals and businesses. Each NFT will include information such as the plantation date, tree Geolocation, the type of tree etc. This will serve in establishing a personal connection between the sponsor and the tree through gamification features as well as assisting the collection of data for accademic researches and studies. 

At the core of our platform,  will be our blockchain token acting as a representation of positive environmental behaviour. Each token will be pegged against one kilogram of greenhouse gas absorbed or saved through the actions of the platform and its stakeholder, essentially serving as a CO2 credit for individuals and businesses.

Subsequent stages of the project will include the onboarding of other carbon saving projects and activities and will reward individuals and business with CO2 credit tokens accordingly.

#### Competition

Other environmental and sustainability projects have been deployed on various blockchains in the past. Some of them aim in having a positive environmental impact whereas others are targeting the expanding and lucrative CO2 markets. This section analyses two projects as to establish miden's competitve advantage and unique selling points.

- Project 1: https://www.nftreehaus.com/

NFTree Haus is a Polygon based project aiming in gamefying certain features and steps of the plantation process.

- Project 2: https://www.klimadao.finance/

KlimaDAO is a project focusing on green economy. It is built Polygon network, and uses a stack of technologies to reduce market fragmentation and accelerate the delivery of climate finance to sustainability projects globally.

#### miden competitive advantage

Although similar projects have been deployed in the past on other networks, miden has a unique position in the market as it is much broader in scope than the other projects. More specifically, miden aims in creating a possitive feedback loop in reinforcing the connection of people with nature through the encourangement of sustainable behaviour, education and reward mechanisms. 

![circularity-08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11577319/227622327-faa1fb90-2b7d-4864-8e42-4ae3d38d7aa6.png)

This holistic approach alloes miden to target new markets and gain competitve advantage. In addition, miden can utilise fee deligation features of Vechain which will allow it to increase its appeal to market participants that are not familiar with blockchain. To our knowledge no similar projects exist on Vechain blockchain.

#### Synergies with Vechain

- Allignment of scope between Vechain and miden in creating a sustainable new world through blockchain innovation.
- Synergies can arise between miden and other carbon initiaves that are already built or which will be deployed on Vechain further expanding the scope and capabilities of miden. Examples can include the carbon calculator, recently launched by Vechain.
