One-stop app that connects producers with consumers and captures all value chain data from end to end. Empowering producers and building D2C models with blockchain.
Connect producers with consumers and capture all value chain data E2E
Enable African Enterprises to introduce and complete Proof of Concepts on Blockchain Efficiently.
Madini TraceChain is a platform that engages producers with consumers and enables them to gather and share data with the public via a QR code. All the information is encrypted and secured on VeChain blockchain, and is unforgeable and available worldwide.

    An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem.
    
At Madini, we believe VeChain Thor Blockchain has the potential to powerfully disrupt many aspects of how businesses and economies work, even how societies are organised. Blockchain goes to the core of the role of trust in African Products – an area that is central to Madini purpose. This shapes the way we think through the challenges Africa faces – bringing together business acumen, user experience design, and existing and emerging technology. 
We deliver blockchain solutions that reflect African specific business needs, and provide trust, transparency, and security. Together, we can differentiate your business and help you set the stage for future growth.
Fast and safe trade
As a pioneer in transparent trade value chains, Madini TraceChain aims to empower African producers by establishing a direct market linkage facilitation to incentivize regeneration, from soil to economy to society at large with a powerful transparency application.
Powered by Bluegate, the TraceChain application collects and uploads authentic product information onto the VeChainThor Blockchain, This enables a traceable, visible, and transparent digital marketplace for the African market, which allows for producers, processors, packers, distributors, brands and other added-value stakeholders to publicly list Organization and Product profiles to access global markets.

A force for the good
Many projects leverage blockchain to increase supply chain transparency and detect operational inefficiencies as well as new business opportunities. However, few of them are as impact driven as TraceChain. In addition to private corporations, Bluegate works with governmental organisations and NGOs to have a positive social impact and empower underserved producers. 
At Bluegate, we believe VeChain has the potential to powerfully disrupt many aspects of how African Markets work, and provide trust, transparency, and security to the supply chain. This includes artisans and small-scale farmers being part of our inclusive value chain that underpin human health, well being, livelihoods, jobs and sustainable growth.

Madini TraceChain system is about sustainability, quality, authenticity, fairness, ecological footprint,origin and provenance, safety and traceability. Then the company must gather evidence from their supply chain of the performance for the characteristics chosen, proof of actions by people and machines, documents such as certificates, licenses or chemical analysis and collecting or importing data from production systems (ERPs). 

Madini TraceChain, a blockchain-enabled trade solution can help African companies exploit value via data generated by their own business. The immutable data on the blockchain enables companies to increase the efficiency of compliance review, government supervision, logistics and supplier evaluation and more. Companies will also gain access to world leading third-party services through Bluegate partner network, greatly reducing the cost of certification, audit, insurance or supply chain logistic services.

Bluegate now has specialization in products traceability based on accumulated know-how and refined technology. Joining hands with other strategic partners on this platform, Madini TraceChain aims to expand the business globally to address business needs of more enterprises in the African industry.

How Madini TraceChain Works.

With Madini TraceChain you can easily upload your product descriptions, attributes, photos, 
certificates, documents and videos to the VeChainThor blockchain. When the upload is completed, the 
system will generate an unique QR code assigned to your product. You will also be able to see the 
transaction (TX) ids that your business has generated, giving you a full overview of the number of TXs 
that your products have produced accross the product’s journey.
The hash generated by the Vechain Thor blockchain is used as unique reference number for the product or mineral. This is a very imortant step as the consumer can always verify the authenticity of the product or mineral as the hash linked to it cannot be changed.

1. Product Identification such as product name,description and other attributes.
2. Product Details submitted to the blockchain.
3. QR Code generated as a result of the data submitted to the blockchain.
4. More Information that adds more traceability information to Tracechain that include PDF files such as certificates,images and Map.

Steps to Upload and view traceability information.
•Fill in the required data fields in the form as shown in the screenshots.
•Press on the create button to upload and hash the data to the blockchain.
•Click on the enter action button to view the details of the whole process and to have a view of the QR code generated,for the QR There’s no need of a special APP or device to read your QR codes and verify your products. Any QR reader installed on your phone will detect and show the traceability information

Madini MDN Token

MDN VIP180 is the Madini utility token in our ecosystem
Madini (MDN) is one of the first platforms built exclusively to cater to the needs of Africa enter-prise-level clientele on BlockChain. We seek to improve supply chain in Africa and product lifecycle management through the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT). Importantly, the platform of-fers users a variety of new functionalities that make it ideal for businesses seeking to enhance supply chain protocols and business processes.
VeChain provides Madini Ecosystem the ability to track an enormous amount of data. These indica-tors can include items such as quality, authenticity, traceability, and transportation status. Madini, using VeChain, provides African Mineral enterprises all of these features via a trust-free and distrib-uted business ecosystem. In this way, we reduce overhead and improves accountability.

MDN smart contract is build as VIP180 VeChain token. With full usability in Madini Ecosystem, anyone can earn, trade, transfer, pay, receive and invest in Madini MDN. MDN utility token main purpose is paying the services of traceability and is used for the purchases/selling of the minerals/metals.As every stakeholder of the marketplace will have a VeChain wallet, MDN will be used as Trading fee and also as payment option for the minerals.We have created a VeChain Thor – Madini Wallet (Android) to facilitate the Token management and allow the general public to invest, transfer and trade the MDN/VET/VTHO tokens.

MDN – Main token MDN – Main value: adoption and utility (MDN is linked to all the Madini products, main CC for the Madini Wallet and the Madini Marketplace)

Development Roadmap

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an example roadmap. For each milestone:

    Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost.
