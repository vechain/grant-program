### Overview

 NFT Moon Metaverse is the futuristic Create2Earn multi blockchain universe. It will be inhabited by self-driven and creative people craving for boundless opportunities. NFT Moon is a metaverse in which a person can build a new life. The main task of the player is to make the planet alive. To do this, convenient constructors are given, where a person builds avatars, houses, objects, cities, countries. All interaction is based on Play2Earn and Create2Earn. The entire metaverse is built on plots of land. Plots can already be bought . The plot gives the following opportunities: to divide the land, to rent, to receive income from the metaverse, access to advanced designer features, access to rare avatars.
ID Cards grants the entrance to the Metaverse where each person can build a personalized reality and experience. Besides networking with other MoonWalkers , one has access to a variety of Metaverse assets: land plots, objects, avatars, advanced designer features. There are over 10 beneficial opportunities in NFT Moon Metaverse — from renting land to creating businesses and events.

We are interested in expanding the blockchains that will be used in the metaverse. Now we use four main blockchains: Polygon, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche.
Thanks to the bridge between blockchains, we will implement a bridge for the VeChain blockchain. This will make it possible to move assets of the metaverse (land, ID card, avatars) from other blockchains to the VeChain network and in the opposite direction.
It will also enable holders of land, id cards, avatars to trade them on marketplaces that support VeChain:

 - [World of V](https://marketplace.worldofv.art/)
  - [VeSea](https://vesea.io/)
  - [VPunks](https://vpunks.com/#/)
  - [VimWorld](https://www.vimworld.com/vimmarket)
  - [NFT Paper Project](https://nftpaperproject.com/market)
  - [BlackVeMarket](https://blackvemarket.com/)


Thus, we will create a trading path between different blockchains for NFT Moon Metaverse. 
Example of a bridge that we will use for VeChain:

### Project Details

We have been developing NFT Moon Metaverse for a year now . During this time, we have a large audience, as well as buyers of land, id cards, avatars. Currently, work is underway on the alpha version and the addition of new blockchains to the NFT Moon Metaverse.

### Ecosystem Fit
NFT Moon Metaverse it is an implementation of an online gaming web service based on three.js and blockchain, as well as distributed IOT infrastructure. The service provides users with access to the functionality as a result of authorization using a crypto wallet. Within the framework of the service, the user can use the functionality of systems designed for the processes of creating and editing content, market processes of exchange, purchase and sale and others, financial processes, management processes, learning processes, communication processes and game and non-game interaction of users with each other, as well as with the surrounding virtual world and objects of the surrounding virtual world.
The main mechanics of user-product interaction are create-to-earn and play-to-earn.

Multi-blockchain bridge:

Multi-blockchain bridging is one of the most active areas of blockchain development at the moment, but few projects focus on NFT bridges. Even those that do support only a limited number of chains. The bridge in the NFT Moon Metaverse has the following advantages:

- The first bridge designed exclusively for NFTs, tackling every aspect of asset transition and compatibility across multiple protocols;
- A much wider range of supported blockchains: any chain can be connected to the bridge;
- Linking EVM to a range of non-EVM chains with fundamentally different tech stacks, such as Elrond, Solana, Cardano, Algorand, etc.
- A simple and seamless UI for minting, transfering, and exploring NFTs;
- Attractively low transaction fees, payable in the currency of the origin blockchain (ETH, BNB, SOL etc.);
- Highly scalable: the capacity of the bridge is limited only by the TPS of the bridged chains;
- Possibility to mint NFTs on multiple chains from an easy-to-use UI;
- Superior security and reliability: a multilayer security system capable of preventing all common types of attacks, with no single points of failure;
- A more versatile technological stack, and provide the same level of security and reliability;
- Possibility to integrate the bridge with any NFT dApp, allowing users to trade and exchange NFTs the way they are used to, while the bridge operates behind the scenes;
- Possibility of transferring NFTs in Batches;
- Possibility of transferring NFT smart contract logic;
- Option of choosing the smart contract to mint wrapped NFTs with on the target chain.

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
