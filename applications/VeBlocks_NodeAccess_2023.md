### Overview

Another year has passed and the 3rd milestone of the original grant (https://github.com/vechain/grant-program/blob/master/applications/VeBlocks_upgrade.md) for the VeBlocks public nodes came to an end: 
Delivering 12 months of free and unrestricted access to the VeChain blockchain (2022-2023). This included access to mainnet as well as testnet and a solo-sandbox. 

VeBlocks is a community project created and managed by MiRei in October 2019 (https://twitter.com/MiRei83_/status/1186632017544388608). It is focused around the blockchain infrastructure of the VeChain blockchain (Mainnet, Testnet, etc.). Since then, Veblocks not only aggregates and visualizes blockchain statistics via https://veblocks.net, it also provides free, public and unrestricted access to full-archive-nodes of the Vechain blockchains via https://nodes.veblocks.net. 
The idea is to have a "ready-to-go" solution and lower the threshold and initial cost for new developers. This benefits every developer building on Vechain blockchain and removes all hardware-limitations to get started.

With this grant, I apply for 24 (2x12) months of support for keeping the Veblocks nodes free for public access.

## Project Details

### VeBlocks backend

As mentioned in the overview, the basic functionality to access the vechain blockchain is already adapted. Hosting a public VeChain node requires powerful hardware. Fast responding nodes are achieved via virtualisation on a dedicated bare-metal server with the newest generation of CPUs and NVMe SSDs.
To provide high-availability, load-balancing and clustering of the backend infrastructure additional bare-metal server in different locations are needed.

The backend consist of:
- Two dedicated bare-metal server in two different data-centers
- Each endpoint to have HTTP and HTTPS capabilities and load-balance between at least two nodes
- Access through global CDN (Cloudflare)
- A maintenance- and continuance plan for 12/24 months

This kind of setup requires constant care and support, so a certain amount of time is needed per month to keep the nodes running. Since 2019 I figured that about 1.5 hours per month per server is sufficient.

The goal is to provide a robust, constant, long-term solution.

### Ecosystem Fit

VeBlocks is already used by several applications, including 

- the backend for https://visuals.veblocks.net
- the default gateway for Sync2
- the default gateway for https://insight.vecha.in
- the default gateway for https://explore.veblocks.net
- an optional gateway for Sync
- a sync-node for https://www.vechainstats.com
- the first choice for many developers bulding on VeChain

## Team 

The team consists of:
- MiRei: I am a fulltime IT-professional for 20 years with focus on IT-infrastructures and IT-security. Because of an enormous amount of work, my focus has shifted away from the veblocks project in the recent weeks. With this grant I will be able to reevaluate these priorities.
