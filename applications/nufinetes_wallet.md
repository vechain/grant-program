# VeChain Foundation General Grant Program Application: NUFINETES WALLET

## Project Overview 

- Project: Nufinetes Wallet
- Team Name: VIMWORLD INC. 
- Payment Address: USDT (ERC 20) 0xcdeea48d06fd1b10d06fa94aa931ae39c62f5580 or VeUSD (VIP 180) 0x189Fb3e5842d7BAe958dA36537268579eD7Ed78C

### Overview

We will develop a new wallet for the VeChain community. The existing selection of VeChain wallets exhibit a number of drawbacks, including hardware and operating system limitations, lack of updated web3 connectivity, unintuitive security features, lack of user friendliness, and no multichain functionality.
The Nufinetes wallet project aims to tackle these deficits to make available an attractive, capable, platform agnostic and intuitively secure wallet made specifically for VeChain users. Nufinetes will incorporate the following technical features and improvements:
Nufinetes is a cross-chain, multi-platform (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS) digital wallet supporting crypto asset custody and dApp operations for VeChain, Ethereum, BSC, AVAX, Polygon and many more public/private blockchains.
Nufinetes is entirely decentralized, as no single point of failure is present and can work as an offline wallet if need be.
Nufinetes is also WalletConnect-compatible, making it easier to sign transactions on mobile devices through the capture of a QR code. It also makes EVM-based dApps compatible with Nufinetes directly without any modification.
Nufinetes uses the highest level of security, storing encrypted private keys locally and making sure they are tamper-proof.

### Project Details

The wallet will be compatible with Android, iOS, macOS and Windows operating systems. It will allow users to create new wallets on the VeChainThor, Ethereum and other networks, send and receive tokens on these respective networks, and connect to web3 enabled sites to interact with smart contracts.

Pictures and a preview of how the wallet looks can be seen at https://www.nufinetes.com/.

Nufinetes is built using the following technologies:
Frontend: Javascript on React Native/React/Redux.
Backend: Golang, Python, Node.js Framework.
Database: MongoDB, Redis, VeChain Blockchain.
GitLab - CI/CD.

### Ecosystem Fit

VeChain users are currently faced by a selection of wallets which all represent some degree of compromise: VeChainThor Mobile wallet is secure, but is available only for mobile devices, it also can be slow to load and has a clunky interface. Comet is available as an extension for Chrome browsers, but has not been updated in >1 year. VeChain’s Sync is a standalone browser only available on Desktop devices, lacking connectivity and integral token transfer capability. VeChain’s Sync2 is the most recently released wallet and offers advanced connectivity features, but a minimalist and non-intuitive interface not suited to new users. It also lacks some basic user protections such as not forcing the backup of the seed phrase. None of the above wallets have multi-chain functionality. 
The Nufinetes wallet project aims to tackle these deficits to make available an attractive, capable, platform agnostic and intuitively secure wallet made specifically for VeChain users. This will lower the barrier to adoption and encourage the growth of the VeChain dApp ecosystem. Please see the above overview section for a rundown of its capabilities.

#### Phase 1 and Phase 2 — Roadmap/Technical summary 

The key reporting milestone at each stage will be the public release of the wallet.

Brief description of technical goals for Phase 1:
Support VeChain and Ethereum wallets;
Support all four platforms: Windows, Mac, Android, iOS;
Support WalletConnect protocol and basic features;
Create an SDK for integration with Nufinetes on Vechain and Ethereum;
Support switching between networks and testnets.

Brief description of technical goals for Phase 2:
Support contact (wallet address) list management;
Support NFT viewer for VeChain and Ethereum;
Support more advanced WalletConnect features;
Support more public and private blockchains and networks.

#### Community engagement

Along with at least one Medium article where the VeChain Foundation will be acknowledged, we will produce a series of video tutorials on how to use the wallet. We will also actively promote the wallet on social media, engaging with the VeChain community and beyond.

## Future Plans

The production of the Nufinetes wallet is an important part of VIMworld’s overall building of an ecosystem around the VIM “smart NFTs” native to the VeChainThor blockchain. VIMs are collectible, dynamic NFTs representing unique characters that allow users to participate in interactive experiences such as “play to earn” games, and provide their owners with a variety of benefits. See our public project proposal “PPP” for more information https://vimworld.com/ppp/english.pdf. 

## Additional Information 

An Alpha test version has been released and is under iterative improvement with assistance from VeChain community testers.

VIMworld has funded development of the project up until the present.

No other grants have been applied for yet.
