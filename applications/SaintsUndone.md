# **Project Name:** Saints Undone Fashion NFT Phygital Project

**Introduction:** We are excited to submit our grant application for the "Saints Undone" Fashion NFT Phygital Project under the VeChain General Grant Program. Our project represents the convergence of fashion, art, technology, and blockchain, contributing to the VeChain ecosystem's innovation and growth.

**Project Description:** The Saints Undone Fashion NFT Phygital Project is a groundbreaking initiative that bridges the gap between physical and digital fashion experiences. Our project combines the creation of unique NFT wearables with a virtual AR/VR experience. These wearables, embedded with NFTs, enable wearers to showcase art pieces inspired by renaissance art on their physical clothing while engaging in immersive virtual fashion events.

**Funding Request:** We request funding of $30,000 to support the development and launch of this innovative project.

**Project Eligibility:**

-   **Subject Depth:**
Saints Undone is at the intersection of art, fashion, and technology, offering a groundbreaking approach to the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and wearables. Fashion NFT wearables have the potential to revolutionize the way individuals engage with art and fashion. By encapsulating renaissance art's historical and mythological significance within wearable NFTs, we create a unique fusion of the physical and digital worlds. These NFT wearables enable collectors to not only appreciate art but also wear it, making it an integral part of their identity. This innovative concept capitalizes on the growing interest in NFTs and the desire for exclusivity, personalization, and storytelling in the fashion industry.

Fashion NFT wearables offer several advantages, including:

- Uniqueness: Each wearable NFT is a one-of-a-kind piece of art, enhancing its desirability among collectors and enthusiasts.

- Interactivity: Wearers can personalize and modify these digital fashion items, fostering a sense of ownership and creative expression.

- Social Engagement: QR code integration encourages wearers to become walking advertisements, inviting others to discover and engage with the art, thereby promoting organic brand growth.

- Digital Rarity: Limiting the reselling of wearables replicates the concept of limited editions in the traditional art market, increasing their scarcity and potential appreciation over time.

- Contribution to VeChain Ecosystem: Saints Undone directly contributes to the VeChain ecosystem by leveraging its blockchain technology for transparent and secure ownership of NFT wearables.

Front End:

  - React JS for building the user interface and interactive components.
  - Redux for state management, ensuring efficient data flow.
  - React Router for handling client-side routing within the website.
  - Styled Components for styling and theming the UI elements.
  - Web3.js for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and handling NFT-related transactions.

Back End:

- Node.js as the runtime environment for the server.
- Express.js for creating the RESTful API and handling server-side logic.
- Solidity for developing smart contracts to manage NFT minting, ownership, and transactions on the blockchain.
- PostgreSQL as the relational database management system (DBMS) for storing user and NFT data.
- Redis for queue management (caching), utilizing Bulk Queue for handling background tasks efficiently.
- AWS (Amazon Web Services) for managing the server infrastructure with EC2 instances, RDS (Relational Database Service) for PostgreSQL, ElasticCache for Redis caching, and Load Balancers for optimizing traffic distribution.
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized file storage, allowing efficient and secure storage of NFT metadata and assets.

Metaverse Development:

- Unreal Engine, a powerful game development platform, for creating the metaverse and immersive experiences.
  (Unreal Engine provides advanced rendering capabilities, physics simulation, and support for high-quality 3D assets, enabling the creation of visually stunning and interactive virtual environments.)

User Authentication and Security:

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and authorization, ensuring user data protection.
- HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for secure data transmission between the client and server.
- OAuth for third-party authentication and social login integration, enhancing user convenience.

Deployment and Scalability:

- Docker for containerization, allowing easy deployment and scaling of application components.
- Kubernetes for container orchestration, automating deployment, scaling, and management of application containers.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment processes.
  
**Commitment to Maintenance:** 

We are committed to maintaining the project post-grant through a sustainable business model.

**Project Uniqueness:** 

Our project stands out by infusing renaissance art into NFT wearables, offering a unique and interactive fashion experience. "Cult Spatial" adds a virtual dimension, enabling fashion enthusiasts to explore and engage with art in new ways,since we have worked in fashion industry before we have to explore the NFT space

**Contribution to VeChain Ecosystem:** 
Saints Undone's Fashion NFT Phygital Project directly contributes to the VeChain ecosystem by demonstrating the versatility and applicability of VeChain's blockchain technology in the fashion industry.
