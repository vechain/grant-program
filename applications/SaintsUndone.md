This revenue-sharing model ensures that artists are fairly compensated for their work while supporting the platform's growth.

This subscription-based model will offer insights into user behavior and trends, enabling enterprises to make data-driven decisions regarding marketing and promotional activities. The revenue generated from enterprise access will support the maintenance and expansion of the platform.

4.  _Fiat Integration:_ Saints Undone will explore the integration of fiat on-ramps, enabling users to purchase NFT wearables with traditional currencies. This approach opens up the platform to a broader user base, facilitating a seamless onboarding process for newcomers to the NFT space.
