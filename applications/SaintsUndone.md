A portion of the sales revenue will go to the creators, while a percentage will be allocated to the project to support ongoing development, marketing, and operational costs. This revenue-sharing model ensures that artists are fairly compensated for their work while supporting the platform's growth.
2.  _Resale of NFT Cuts:_ To encourage users and collectors to engage with the platform continuously, Saints Undone will facilitate the resale of NFT cuts. When users resell their NFT wearables on the secondary market, the project will charge a small transaction fee.
3.  _Enterprise Access:_ Saints Undone will introduce an enterprise access tier, allowing businesses to access advanced features and analytics. This subscription-based model will offer insights into user behavior and trends, enabling enterprises to make data-driven decisions regarding marketing and promotional activities. The revenue generated from enterprise access will support the maintenance and expansion of the platform.

4.  _Fiat Integration:_ Saints Undone will explore the integration of fiat on-ramps, enabling users to purchase NFT wearables with traditional currencies. This approach opens up the platform to a broader user base, facilitating a seamless onboarding process for newcomers to the NFT space. The revenue generated from fiat transactions will be reinvested into platform operations and improvements.
