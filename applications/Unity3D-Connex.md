### Overview

Overview - We aim to create a connection between Unity3D and VeChain.

Why VeChain? - Virtual Flame Studios operates an NFT company on VeChain. We love the fast transaction speed, low gas fees, and overall potential of VeChain technology. The grant program is a great way to incentivise building more tools for the blockchain. 

Sync2/Connex + Virtual Flame Studios will utilize blockchain information to reflect assets of a user’s VeChain wallet and in-game assets using Sync2/Connex to authenticate the user and their game profile. We will use VeChain Energy to leverage fee delegation protocols so that user’s don’t have to concern themselves with paying gas fees. Virtual Flame Studios will utilize MTT to mint NFTs, and Sync2/Connex to verify and authenticate ownership. 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- API specifications of the core functionality

VeChain Thor Devkit

We will be using the VeChain Thor Devkit for all wallet and TokenID collecting. .Net Core library to assist smooth development on VeChain and will communicate with Unity3D on a certain level.

Unity3D 

A game engine API that we will be utilizing. 




- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

Core Components:
Identify and authenticate connection between Unity3D and VeChain
Mapping VeChain NFT ownership to in-game Unity3D asset ownership
Mock up PoC game to showcase functionality
MySQL Database for storing metadata



- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic:

Virtual Flame Studios houses multiple VeChain NFT projects in which we conduct fun events utilizing VeSea smart contracts, World of V staking contracts, and regularly promotes VeChain’s NFT community. 

Geoffrey has coded for multiple games and most recently won a game development contest in which game teams have 72 hours to complete a game from scratch. Attached are some links Geoffrey has developed and coded for.

### Ecosystem Fit
Exoworlds is a gaming NFT collection built on Unreal Engine and VeChain. They recently won a hackathon for connex to C+/UE5 compatibility. We plan to utilize Unity & C# for complimentary tooling for Unity3D, allowing VeChain to communicate with the two biggest game development engines in the world. There are over 4.5 million Unity3D developers worldwide!

### Team's experience


Zachery Barnes - Zachery has ran Virtual Flame Studios on VeChain since November 2021. Very enthusiastic about VeChain technology, VeFam community, and community management. 

Dylan Barnes - Business management. Co-directed the SHREDDERZ breeding event. Dylan maintains a great relationship with VeChain contributors and developers in the space, allowing for quick problem solving and novel implementation. A great example of this is our breeding event that was hosted by VeSea and facilitated by our team members. Collectors were allowed to pair any two SHREDDERZ to make a child “shreddiez”. The event was unique because the shreddiez were not pre-generated and only created upon the user breeding two NFTs. The shreddiez were created based on the traits the user chose to breed together. To our knowledge, this has never been achieved on any chain.

Geoffrey Hendrikx - Unity3D programmer who has 10 years of coding experience. Experience with various languages Including: C#, C++, Python, HTML/CSS and Javascript. Passed 2 educations as a Game Developer Programmer. Experience in writing efficient code with an OOP Base and an Architectural point.

## Development Roadmap 

![Flow Chart](https://stats.boneraffle.com/images/Flow_Chart.png)


#### Overview

|  | Milestone 1 | Milestone 2 | Total |
| - | - |- | - |
| Estimated Duration | 30d | 60d | 90d |
| Full-time equivalent (FTE) | 4 | 8 | 12 |
| Cost | $10,000 | $20,000 | $30,000 |

![Milestone 1](https://stats.boneraffle.com/images/milestone_1.png)

| 1. | Unity3D Engine x Sync/Connex | Create a simple game that allows a user to connect their VeChain wallet to a Unity3D game using the code we create. Unity3D and VeChain will be able to verify a user's VeChain ID. The Unity3D game will display a verified “green button” to showcase wallet connectivity and will display an unverified “red button” to showcase non-connectivity. |

| 1b. | Documentation | We will provide open source documentation for the code along with a basic tutorial. Developers will be able to build their Unity3D games using our VeChain tools. |

| 1c. | Backend | We will create a backend service that will allow developers to implement VeChain wallet recognition services through Unity3D and Sync2/Connex/VeChain. |




![Milestone 2](https://stats.boneraffle.com/images/milestone_2.png)



| 2. | Query and reflect VeChain NFT token IDs in Unity | Unity will communicate with the data storage systems and reflect in-game assets to the NFT tokens in the users VeChain wallet. 
We will preview this by using GUI to represent NFTs from the users VeChain wallet in the Unity3D Engine game.|

| 2b. | Documentation | We will provide open source documentation for the code along with a basic tutorial. Developers and users will be able to read their TokenIDs from their connected VeChain wallet. |

| 2c. | Backend | We will create a database for the Game Assets. These assets will be reflections of the NFTs in the user's connected VeChain wallet. |








#### Community engagement

All Initiatives will showcase the tools, code, and mention the opportunity VeChain Grant allowed.

## Future Plans

MECHALOMANIACS: We plan to launch a digital tabletop game that allows users to collect and build decks in which they battle with. We want to utilize VeChain to encourage frequent trading and collecting by leveraging VeChain’s Fee Delegation. We want as much of the interactions and history to be as on-chain as possible. VeChain has many exciting projects being built, but currently has no trading card game in development. Mechalomaniacs looks to change that. 

## Additional Information 

The entire Mechalomaniacs game GDD is complete and ready to be implemented. We hope to use these tools ourselves to bring our game to life on VeChain.

Zachery Barnes is known on Twitter as “Flame” and hosts VeChain Thorsday Twitter spaces on behalf of the Foundation. 

Dylan Barnes is known on Twitter as “Ferg” and hosts VeChain Project Leader Twitter spaces alongside VeChain leaders in the space. 

Geoffrey Hendrikx is a well known Unity3D developer and is highly respected by his peers. This is Geoffrey’s first time building on VeChain and he can’t wait to share what he’s up to with all of his community groups on Unity3D platforms. 

Virtual Flame Studios has great working relationships with many builders on VeChain. We have established a strong NFT community and have promoted VeChain far and wide. We are honored to be builders and participants in VeChain technology.
