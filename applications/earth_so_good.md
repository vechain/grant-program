## Project Overview

- Project: Project Borneo
- Team Name: EarthSoGood
- Payment Address: 0xF425DC2Ab8dd43ac20b56BC701c5D2ee53105226

### Overview

#### Project Description

Project Borneo serves to utilize NFTs to fund and support the restoration and redevelopment of burned areas in Kalimantan Forest. The proceeds of the NFT will be used for reforestation and redevelopment in the specific region to rejuvenate their economy.

The proceeds will support to the local community that commits to the project and helps in the building of infrastructure, proper sanitation, and health services.

#### Tree Planting initiative

Phase 1 involves planting 165,000 trees over an area of 60ha of which 30ha will be set aside for agricultural crops and buffer. The planting method approach will be through direct seeding instead of seedling. Seedlings are young sporophytes (baby plants) which makes the approach "adopting" the baby plants instead of planting new trees. Furthermore, seedling transplant shock may affect the quality of trees.

Advantages of Direct Seeding

- It allows a variety of trees, shrubs, and ground covers to be sown simultaneously
- Trees develop healthier root systems
- Greater effectiveness for extensive reforestation and carbon offset

The species of trees planted are native to the land and are from the class of meranti wood, and studies from the Ministry of Forestry showed that their carbon absorption is up to 1.69 tons/ha/year. In conclusion, the annual estimated offset calculation will be 101,400kg of CO2.

#### ESGNFTs

Total supply of phase 1 NFT: 2,500

NFTs tagged to specific coordinate

The forest will be divided into 55 points over 30ha area, each of which will be assigned a specific coordinate. These 55 coordinates will then be divided into 4 NFT, tagging 220 NFTs in total to a specific location.

Number of trees planted

The first initial mint (1st buyer) will contribute to 22 trees planted, and the next buyer (2nd buyer) of the same NFT will contribute another 22 trees. The resale process is only limited to 2 times; totalling 66 trees (3 Owners).

### Interests in VeChain Ecosystem

The objective of EarthSoGood is to protect our environment with high degree of accountability. We believe that in providing future generations with high standard of living while maintaining a sustainable lifestyle. We are strive to raise awareness of the present predicament, offer solutions, and encourage environmentally friendly initiatives. EarthSoGood believes that in addition to people, other species of plants and animals also have rights on the planet.

We learned that VeChain will embark on a sustainable approach in 2023, and EarthSoGood recognize an opportunity to collaborate as our missions are aligned. The EarthSoGood initiative seeks to mitigate the issues of double counting carbon credits and generate high-quality carbon offsets. We believe our project can benefit VeChain's efforts to go in the direction of sustainability and net-zero emissions.

EarthSoGood also hopes to collaborate with the VeChain network to enhance the value of the initiative. VeChain is well-known and one of the few blockchains with a substantial customer base among well-established businesses. EarthSoGood wishes to enhance the project's value and increase its recognition by collaborating with VeSea, the VeChain NFTs marketplace.

### Project Details

EarthSoGood is an initiative of green network co-founded jointly by Anthony Koh, Joseph Koh, and Teck Hiong, together with Benjamin Ng and his team at Asia Carbon Connect. EarthSoGood strives to add a positive impact on society by actively engaging & advocating sustainable business practices and personal lifestyle choices.

Currently, the green economy needs to grow at least 15 times larger to meet the growing demand for quality carbon credits. EarthSoGood plans to build a community committed to decarbonization.

This initiative aims to meaningfully mitigate global climate change effects by funding environmentally friendly initiatives (Green Projects), while also eliminating the double-counting of carbon credits (VCUs) and project transparency, as businesses work toward net-zero emissions.

As such, the proceeds of the NFT sales not only support forest restoration and community development projects on the island of Borneo but also includes the development of our carbon marketplace (Asia Carbon Connect).

#### Utility Token (ESGT)

The Earth So Good Token (ESGT) was developed to serve as the keystone connecting ongoing and upcoming green projects into a cohesive ecosystem that benefits the community. For example, while conducting ESGT airdrops, the rarity of each NFT will be taken into consideration.

ESGT Functional Usage

1. ESGT serves as the highway that allows users to retire carbon credits
2. Users can use ESGT to stake on future carbon credits projects
3. Users can use ESGT to offset individual carbon footprint and contributes directly to any partnering NGO efforts in their respective communities.

Transactions throughout the ecosystem will be made simpler by the introduction of the ESGT. ESGT offers access to our ecosystem of carbon credits. Holders of ESGT can utilize the token to get discounted carbon offset prices on the Asia Carbon Connect platform. In addition, ESGT will be used to recognize members of our community who support green initiatives by using NFTs to fund green projects or retiring VCUs from service on the Asia Carbon Connect marketplace.

ESGT Features

1. Airdrop rewards. There will be an airdrop of tokens for ESGT holders every quarter.
2. A Membership discount plan for the Asia Carbon Connect marketplace can be bought with ESGT.
3. Green Projects. ESGT holders can invest in sub-projects for annual percentage yield, moreover, ESGT can be used to mint NFTs for future tree planting projects.

In addition to utilizing, it as a medium of exchange, holders of ESGT have the option to stake it in various future projects or to keep it and get rewarded through airdrop rewards. For each tranche of the airdrop, users can reserve a specific amount of ESGT holding; all they must do is prove ownership while redeeming their ESGT airdrops. There will be no minimum holding period required for users to qualify for airdrop rewards.

Furthermore, ESGT will enable the EarthSoGood community to work together on future initiatives and collaborations.

### Ecosystem Fit

#### Katalyst.Earth

There are other projects like EarthSoGood initiative. For example, Katalyst.Earth. Similar to EarthSoGood, Katalyst.Earth uses NFTs to fund carbon sequestration.

Katalyst.Earth roadmap shows that they will have 10,000 genesis NFTs released in 5 tiers.

Tier 1: 100 NFTs

Tier 2: 900 NFTs

Tier 3: 2000 NFTs

Tier 4: 3000 NFTs

Tier 5: 4000 NFTs

According to a Digital Nation article, Katalyst.Earth will be planting 5,000 trees on a farm and will be funded through the sales of 100 NFTs. Katalyst.Earth mainly focuses on planting trees or working with farmers to implement regenerative agricultural practices.

Moving forward, Katalyst.Earth will start calls to business to partner with environment project developers and fund their developments through NFT sales and eventually turn the project into a verified carbon project.

#### EarthSoGood

Unlike other programs, EarthSoGood is transparent and open with our work. These include, but not limited to, announcing the precise position of our project, tagging our ESGNFTs to a particular coordinate, and rewarding our NFT collectors with a visit to the project site to authenticate our work. In addition to being transparent, EarthSoGood has a partnership agreement with Yayasan Indonesia Green International, an NGO based in Indonesia (YIGI). A minimum of three years' worth of periodic reviews of the area, to be done once every six months, will be supplied by YIGI as the NGO managing the project in Kalimantan, which entails the planting of 165,000 trees.

Additionally, because YIGI maintained a strong relationship with the local community, the EarthSoGood initiative was supported by locals, allowing us to conduct productive fieldwork.

Moving forward, EarthSoGood has a few pending green projects on a larger scale with the MOU agreement signed.

Lastly, we have ESGT to be a bridge for EarthSoGood and Asia Carbon Connect for the EarthSoGood community to work together on future initiatives and collaborations.

### Project Scope

#### Development Process of EGST Utility Token

##### 1. Whitepaper:

A white paper is an authoritative report or guide issued by an ICO launching companies to inform potential investors about their particular product, service, technology or methodology.

Usual structure of white paper written by us, but we are agile enough to make changes in format according to the project.

###### Marketing

- Detailed problem statement
- Proposed solution
- Market Analysis
- Competitor Analysis
- SWOT
- Stakeholder Analysis
- Business Model
- Future Plan

##### 2. SmartContract :

It is a decentralised logic which is deployed on the Blockchain, in them, any algorithm can be encoded. Basically, ERC20 standardised tokens are developed and are based on the requirements. We use solidity language for writing a smart contract which is designed to target VeChain / Ethereum Virtual Machine. The smart contract is self-sufﬁcient to carry out an ICO, the users can just send VET / ether to smart contract address and they will receive tokens from the contract to the address from which they sent VET / ether.

- Highly secure and ﬂexible.
- Goes through a rigorous testing phase by our team of white hat hackers.
- Audited by a team of Solidity experts

##### 3. AIRDROPS / ICO Website :

The ICO/Crowdsale design and structure is explained on the Landing page designed for the best user experience. We may also wire frame the ICO interface with the smart contract, in case we need to show the transaction and events taking place in the sale of Coins. The user interface of ICO is integrated along with the dashboard for better user experience.

- Best UI/UX provided citing the cryptocurrency market.
- Can be integrated with smart contracts.
- Can be integrated with the investment dashboard.

##### 4. Investment Dashboard :

It is a web application developed to improve user experience exponentially. Helps users buy tokens. This does not transfer actual tokens immediately but only credits balances in the database. Once the ICO is over, we distribute actual tokens to the holders. There will be an airdrop of tokens for holders every quarter.

- It is one of the premium products developed by us to make the whole process of crowd-sale hassle free.
- We were the ﬁrst one in the blockchain space to develop such a solution for ICO projects.
- We have deployed many dashboards and can help integrate payments through credit cards(Optional) too.

##### 5. Coin Distribution :

After ICO is over, we will do coin distribution, while conducting ESGT airdrops, the rarity of each NFT will be taken into consideration.

##### 6. Staking and Yield Rewards Management:

Will develop the module where users can Stake and Yield the ESGT. Users can use ESGT to stake on future carbon credits projects. ESGT holders can invest in sub-projects for Annual percentage yield, moreover, ESGT can be used to mint NFTs for future tree planting projects.

##### 7. Listing On Exchange:

We will provide all technical expertise and give full support and help to list your coin on an exchange. Any fees taken by exchange will be given by the user to exchange directly.

_Figure 5: Future plans_

EarthSoGood currently has pending lands waiting for the assessment to be conducted. In addition to our green projects of tree planting and obtaining quality carbon credits, EarthSoGood is working on an educational game that allows us to spread awareness of the current climate issues.

Educational Game

The game will develop to enlighten the public about environmental causes and how leading a sustainable lifestyle may benefit the planet.

It will be a unique approach as EarthSoGood will be using the opportunity of a game to allow people to learn better; according to research, games in teaching can help increase participation, motivation, and emotional learning.

EarthSoGood will introduce a playing incentive program to entice people to participate in the game. Players can simultaneously get perks and receive rewards while learning. Therefore, we believe that utilizing games might efficiently increase awareness of the current situation.
