### Overview

World Of V Is a digital art collection featuring Vechain journey around the world seen by the eyes of different artists.

The Genesis collection is a set of 200 uniques NFTs introducing a combination of digital art and collectibles with a value hierarchy determined by both the creator and the consumer of the artwork.

Additionally the control over what could be the rarest of all traits – **the name** – is given to the full extent to the consumer.

-  Created by over 50 artists globally.
-  Random distribution for full fairness.
-  Naming becomes a scarce commodity via the WoV token mechanism.

Use Multi-clauses & Fee delegation to Pay for the creator using the platform when minting the NFTs, that’s the coolest feature we are excited about using VeChain.

We hope to ease the steps of purchasing and selling by using the MTT feature (approve, transfer in one transaction using multi-clauses).
