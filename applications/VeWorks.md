### Overview

VeWorks is a decentralized platform based on the freelancers and customers based on the VEChain blockchain. Using this platform, users can provide and set services, evaluate freelancers and customers and communicate and display their work portfolio . Veworks aims to create a seamless and transparent ecosystem for freelancers and customers, while ensuring safe and effective transactions. Our business model is based on a fee of 5% of the total of each contracted service that is discounted to the service provider when withdrawing their funds.

Due to its unique functions and skills, our team is interested in creating the project in the VeChain ecosystem. VeChain provides a powerful and scalable blockchain infrastructure that supports high transaction throughput and makes it very suitable for platforms like Veworks. In addition, the Vechain ecosystem also provides various tools and resources to help improve our project and improve the user experience.

In order to improve our project, we plan to integrate various tools and functions in VEChain ecosystem  such as:

We will use Sync2 and Connex to promote the smooth interaction between our platform and the VeChain blockchain. In this way, users can set up measures such as services and payment safely.

By included the charging candidate agreement, we can use users to transaction without retaining the VTHO token in the wallet to improve the user experience.

The MTT function (multi -task transaction) enables our platform to bundle several tasks into a single transaction, thereby reducing the total transaction cost and improving efficiency.

By using these tools and functions, we want to create a user -friendly, safe and effective platform for freelancers and customers in VeChain Ecosystem.

Our team has a clear vision for the final state of the project. We plan to use the following technologies and methods to develop the platform:

UI model and design: In order to create a visually attractive and user -friendly interface, we use Figma to design the UI model and prototype. For figs, we can work effectively and quickly associate with design ideas, and ensure that users have seamless experience.

Core function: Use Solidity in VeChain Blockchain to implement the core function of Veworks, such as service management, comments and message transmission. This can ensure the security and transparent transaction and decentralization of the platform.

Technology stack: We will use modern technology stacks to build VeWorks, including:

For the front -end reaction, we can create fast, fast and interactive user interface through it.
The back -end node.js, we can support the function of the platform through it created a scalable and effective server infrastructure.
The Vechain blockchain providing smart contracts provides a safe and reliable foundation for the core function of the platform.
Documents: In order to ensure a thorough understanding of the components, protocols and architectures of the platform, we will use Swagger to use API documents and UML diagrams to record our work to visualize the structure and relationship of the system. This comprehensive document will help promote future development, maintain and cooperate.

By using these technologies and methods, we want to create a reliable, secure and user -friendly platform to meet the requirements of freelancers and customers in the Vechain ecosystem

### Ecosystem Fit

Although there are existing free professional platforms, such as UPWork, Fiverr and EthLance, Veworks has brought a unique hopes for the market by using the power of the VeChain ecosystem. Here are some important differences. These features distinguish Vework from traditional and other blockchain -based professional platforms:

Power decentralization: VEWORKS is based on the VEChain blockchain, which provides a decentralized and secure platform. This ensures trust, transparency, and review of resistance, which is essential for free communities. In contrast, platforms such as UpWork and Fiverr are concentrated, while EthLance is based on Ethereum blockchain.

VeChain Token: By using VeChain, Veworks rationalized transactions and reduced costs. This can also help users avoid issues related to currency conversion and international payment processing. Traditional platforms use legal currencies, while ETHLANCE trades based on ETH and ERC-20 tokens.

Improved security: VeChain blockchain provides a security basis for the management of user data and sensitive information, thereby reducing the risk of fraud and data damage. This advantage distinguishes Veworks from central platforms such as UPWork and Fiverr.

Message transmission system: Veworks provides an integrated message transmission system. Customers and freelancers communicate directly on the platform to ensure privacy and achieve effective cooperation. Although other platforms also have a message transmission system, Veworks' message transmission has been integrated into the decentralized nature of the platform.

Controversy: The platform includes a dispute and reconciliation process. Users can increase disputes and resolve conflicts through this process without relying on central people in the middle. Compared with UPWORK and Fiverr, this is a significant feature, and ETHLANCE has a similar dispute reconciliation mechanism due to its decentralized properties but using ETH.

Evaluation system: Veworks provides a comprehensive evaluation system for freelancers and customers. These freelancers and customers promote trust and accountability within the platform. Although other platforms also have evaluation systems, the VeWorks evaluation system benefits from transparentness and unchanged blockchain technology.

User-friendly interface – Focus on availability, VEWORKS design allows you to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience for them to navigate and complete the platform. This can set it apart from other blockchain-based platforms, as these platforms can have a steep learning curve.

Looking back, VeWorks offers a unique solution that is tailor-made based on the needs of the free professional community in the VeChain ecosystem. By utilizing the advantages of blockchain technology and taking action against the shortcomings of traditional and decentralized blockchain-based professional platforms, VeWorks is suitable for clients and freelancers seeking secure, transparent and easy-to-use platforms.
