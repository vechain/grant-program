### Overview

VeChain Name Service (VNS) is a decentralized name service built on the VeChainThor blockchain. VNS aims to facilitate VeChain ecosystem growth by enhancing the usability of interactions within the blockchain. Users can customize their VeChain wallet address from the 42-character series of random numbers and letters to a human-readable format. This simple infrastructure element allows for a smoother transfer or exchange of digital assets, such as cryptocurrency or NFTs, between VeChain users. VNS will integrate with VeChain wallets, Marketplaces, and other DApps to provide an easy-to-use naming convention for on-chain transactions.

### Ecosystem Fit

VeChain Name Service (VNS) is a decentralized naming service similar to Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) and NF Domains on the Algorand blockchain. VNS, like these other services, aims to improve the usability of blockchain interactions by allowing users to customize their VeChain wallet address with a human-readable format. The critical difference is that VNS is the only naming service that will soon be available on the VeChainThor blockchain, making it a one-of-a-kind and necessary project for the VeChain ecosystem. In addition, VNS is set to integrate with VeChain wallets, marketplaces, and other DApps, providing an easy-to-use naming convention for on-chain transactions, which will help drive the VeChain ecosystem's adoption and growth.

## Team 

The VeChain Name Service (VNS) team is a small but highly skilled and experienced group of developers and business professionals. They have a deep understanding of the VeChainThor blockchain and are passionate about building innovative solutions to help grow the VeChain ecosystem. The VNS team is confident that they have the technical skills and experience needed to complete the task of building a decentralized name service for the VeChainThor blockchain. They are committed to providing a user-friendly and secure platform that will allow VeChain users to customize their wallet addresses and improve the usability of interactions within the blockchain.

It should be noted that VNS domains was a project originally started by another enitity not affiliated with the current team. The only assets that were transitioned to the current team was the name "VNS Domains" and the domain name www.vns.domains. No previous financial grants were award to the current team by Vechain foundation or any other entity.

#### Current Status

Since taking over the project from another entity, VNS Domains has successfully formed a legal business entity and has retained legal counsel to manage all policy and documentation related to the VeChain Name Service. From a development standpoint, the frontend design and user flow of the Dapp have been completed and are currently undergoing extensive testing. The smart contracts have been developed, inspired by the [Ethereum Name Service smart contracts](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens/tree/master/contracts), and are now in the testing phase on our Solo Node. Once the Solo Node and backend testing are completed, the VNS Team will proceed with deploying VNS to Testnet. Additionally, VNS Domains has identified the need for a pricing Oracle on Vechain in order to sync VET price for domain purchases. The VNS Team was able to develop an Oracle dapp to facilite this requirement.

#### Community engagement

VNS Community Engagement aims to boost engagement and awareness of VNS. The strategy updates the community on VNS platform development via Twitter, Medium and Reddit. Content creation, giveaways, and influencer outreach educate the community about VNS's benefits and establish it as the naming service of choice for Vechain. Community building will help early adopters feel connected and improve the VNS before launch. The strategy's results will guide future marketing.

Social Media: Utilize Twitter (https://vns.domains), Medium and Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/vnsdomains) as primary platforms for community engagement and updates on the development of the VNS (Testnet and Main Launch).

Content Creation: We have developed a content calendar that includes a mix of informative posts, videos, and graphics that educate the community on the benefits of VNS and how to create/use VNS domains.

Giveaways: We plan to use Twitter and Reddit giveaways to incentivize engagement and increase awareness of the VNS.

Influencer Outreach: Reach out to community influencers and thought leaders to help spread the word about the VNS and increase credibility.

Community Building: Foster a sense of community among early adopters by creating a Telegram and/or Discord group where they can ask questions, give feedback and share their experiences.

Timing: Coordinate the VNS launch with other relevant community events to maximize visibility and exposure.

Measurement: Establish metrics to measure the success of the pre-launch marketing strategy and make adjustments as necessary.

## Future Plans

- Education and awareness: VNS will prioritize education and awareness efforts to help users understand the benefits and capabilities of the platform and the VeChainThor blockchain as a whole. This will involve the creation of educational resources and content to accompany all things VNS & VeChain, as well as collaborating with established community members and platforms.
- Growth of the team: As VNS grows, so too will the need for our team to do the same. Encouraging more builders (front & back-end) and core contributors to the ecosystem will be paramount to ensuring there is continued innovation.
- Non-Profit Organization & DAO: VNS will aim to transition into a non-profit organization with the mission to drive the ecosystem as a whole as opposed to revenue generation. Within this, it is idealized that VNS would create a DAO format to operate within to achieve truly decentralized and community orientated goals to promote a more equitable and user-centric VeChain/Web3 ecosystem.
- Focus on user experience: To encourage adoption by new users and Web3 ‘veterans’ alike, VNS aims to prioritize the user experience of our platform. This will be achieved through the creation of intuitive interfaces and the simplification of ‘complex’ processes.
- Features: Fee delegation through VeChain Energy, Internationalized domain names to expand the languages available & accessible to users around the world, emoji domain names to provide a visually appealing and more expressive medium, customizable extensions/subdomain capability, bulk registration, in-built domain marketplace for secondary sales, discounted domain registration fees through various means, referral program.
- Support for all things Web3: VNS will continually seek opportunities to integrate with established and emerging platforms, projects and use cases. This includes supporting the potential future for social media integrations and cross-chain capability for VNS.
- Provide value to enterprise clients: VNS aims to assist enterprise clients of the VeChain foundation through domain registration, management and verification to enhance aspects of their supply chain management, file management and overall Web3 business operations.

## Additional Information 

- Virgo & Kiwi have financially contributed to the project since build inception in late 2021 and continue to do so for aspects of domain registration, server hosting etc.
