## Project Overview 

- Project: LearnOnChain
- Team Name: LearnOnChain
- Payment Address: 0xF193a020af3fC92255BC8DC6fBb98Be487306849

### Overview
Our vision is to create a Web3 platform for classroom environment learning, lecture theatre-style education and 1:1 private tutoring. The virtual university-style campus will connect students and teachers from around the world in a safe and secure platform.

Currently, factors such as discrimination, conflict, poverty, and distance influence a person’s ability when seeking education. Our goal is to build a better world where anyone can access education without barriers.

Users will be displayed as a virtual fully customizable avatar to maintain privacy as they explore the campus and attend classes. Teachers will earn an income from providing their services. NFTs such as buildings and avatar upgrades will support the community eco-system. 

*VeChain Ecosystem Fit*
* We have long been a strong advocate for the VeChain Ecosystem and have always favoured it as our preferred technological partner since the inception of this project. Factors such as a focus on real world adoption, sustainability and governance are some of the reasons why we are interested in working within the VeChain Ecosystem.
* Additionally, as many of the users will be children or people in vulnerable positions faced with factors such as social-economic conditions, cultural norms, or regional disparities the security of users is paramount. Hence, why we strongly believe VeChain can deliver this goal in protecting the integrity and privacy of every user on the platform.
* Users will access the virtual campus by connecting to the integrated Sync2 Wallet that allows users to manage the platform's native token $LEARN. Through the Sync2 Wallet users can pay for classes, and tutoring sessions, purchase NFTs, alongside earn $LEARN from teaching and renting out campus NFT buildings.
* The LearnOnChain dApp will use Connex to connect to the VeChain Blockchain. 

### Project Details

The primary purpose of this grant application is to seek support to build a prototype with UI designs which can then be used to seek multi-year project funding from venture capitalists.

| Component | Description |
|-|-|
| Vercel | Cloud hosting and development platform allowing rapid scalable development. The front and back end of the LearnOnChain platform can be hosted on Vercel. |
| NextJS | A React-based web application framework containing both the front and back end of the platform. |
| Web Application | The frontend user interface for the application – built in NextJS. This will be a browser-based web application and is how users will interact with the platform. |
| API | The serverless API backend built with NextJS will contain all logic related to the platform. |
| MongoDB Atlas | Cloud hosting platform for MongoDB databases. This will host the off-chain database of the LearnOnChain platform. |
| MongoDB | A NoSQL document-based database built using MongoDB responsible for housing off-chain data. |
| VeChain Blockchain | The blockchain network that will be utilised to host any on-chain smart contract functionality. |
| Smart Contracts | Will contain any on-chain logic, written in Solidity. This will include escrow functionality. |
| Connex | Third-party API service allowing for communication between the NextJS application and the VeChain Blockchain. |

### Ecosystem Fit
Currently, only a handful of similar educational Web3 Projects are being built. However, these either mirror the content-based services where educators load hours of videos for viewing which can be found on many websites today or they target corporations in delivering training services. LearnOnChain is unique in focusing on a fun, community-led gamified platform with customizable avatars and a university feel to interact with other students and teachers in the virtual world.

## Team 

Website - learnonchain.io 

**CEO & Founder – Aaron Webb**
* Based in Australia, Aaron currently works for a large multinational bank as a senior information security consultant focused on security governance and regulation, alongside studying for a Diploma in Front and Back End Web Development.
* He recently completed a Master of Cyber Security with Specialisation in Cyber Governance and Management which led to an Academic Excellence Award from the University. After graduating, his research paper on the Cyber Security of Smartwatches was published in an international peer-reviewed journal. 
* Aaron has a strong passion for education and opening the doors for motivated individuals to learn and teach. After seeing the struggles of local students and teachers seeking private tutoring, he realized this problem needs to be addressed. Currently, teachers must advertise their services through social media, word of mouth or rely on intermediaries. Before going through a vetting process, negotiations, and ongoing time management to adapt to changes in tutoring locations and last-minute cancellations. Therefore, a solution to digitalise this process whilst introducing a gamified component and adding an additional layer of security became his passion.
* Aaron is currently writing a research paper on the educational gaps and challenges in countries where cryptocurrency and digital technology are fast becoming ever popular. This will be submitted for publication towards the end of 2023 after a peer review process.

## Development Roadmap 

**Milestone 1** - We are seeking USD 15k for phase one of the commercial roadmap.

This will support the prototype build ($10k) and visual design illustrations ($5k). The prototype build with imagery is expected to take 3-4 weeks. This includes a full product & technical scope with UI/UX design.

**Deliverables** - A prototype mockup of the LearnOnChain dApp with multiple screen interface showing UX in campus free-mode view, classroom environment and welcome page.

**Milestone 2** - USD 10k for the second phase of the roadmap.

This includes prototype integration to the Sync2 Wallet ($7k).

NFT workshop and sample creation designed for launch onto the VeChain blockchain ($2k).

Commercial, Governance and Legal Steps inclusive of the costs in seeking VC Funding* ($1k).

**Deliverables** - A second prototype with Sync2 wallet integrated and NFT imagery.

**Business Model**

LearnOnChain will incorporate multiple revenue streams to ensure the scalability and success of the platform. 
1.	$LEARN will serve as the native token used for in-platform education such as paying for a tutoring session or attending a lecture with the platform taking a % of this fee. 
2.	NFTs will be available for purchase such as campus buildings, avatar upgrades or buying famous characters to represent the user’s avatar (i.e., Albert Einstein). A marketplace will then exist like a student shop that will take a % of each transaction. 
3.	Partnerships with schools, universities, and any corporate or government institution who wish to advertise on the platform through billboards, NFT content or from offering trial classes.
A portion of the profits will fund scholarships that will be offered to those who have a passion for learning regardless of age, culture, or background. These financial aids can then be used to access the education services on the platform free of charge. Whether that’s to attend lectures or a private tutoring session.
Our project plan is highlighted in the whitepaper (available on request) with a projected two-year roadmap to successfully test and launch the platform in a live production environment. 
Phase one includes seeking funding to build a prototype with artwork and imagery. This will then be incorporated into the application process for seeking long-term funding through Venture Capitalists. However, we’re fully open to discussions with VeChain to support this multi-year project. 


#### Community engagement

We will publish detailed project updates on Medium, LinkedIn, and Twitter throughout the development journey. Additionally, as mentioned, a research paper on the benefits of providing an educational dApp platform to disadvantaged communities who also have a strong interest in blockchain will be published later this year in a peered reviewed international journal. 

## Future Plans

Our long-term plans are to seek venture capital funding alongside government grants to build this project over a multi-year development. Marketing will focus on community engagement, and advertising to a global user base whilst securing academic leaders and famous personalities to provide their teaching services. 

* Estimated $500k from VCs & Government Grants will be sought to fund a team of developers to build this dApp over a two-year period.

## Additional Information 

No other grants and/or projects have been engaged with. As mentioned, we feel VeChain has the strongest offering in terms of blockchain privacy, sustainability, and technical integration.
