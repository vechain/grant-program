### Overview

Please provide the following:

- A brief description of the project:
WeFund is a community crowdfunding incubator for blockchain and real-world projects
built on various blockchains. WeFund has the capability to incubate and crowdfund diverse blockchain and real-world projects, bridging the gap between the real world and blockchain.

WeFund has been developed to be a 360- degree incubation service for projects hosted on the WeFund platform through support and guidance before, during, and after funding has been completed.

An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem: 

- WeFund is an incubation and crowdfunding platform that uses blockchain, stablecoins, and smart contracts to make the process more transparent, hold project creators accountable, and minimize risk for project backers. Initially built on Terra, WeFund has received small and medium-sized grants from Polygon, NEAR, and Juno to expand our platform to be a multi-chain system focused on projects with real-world applications. We are looking to implement many blockchains, including VeChain, that align with our mission and community. Our goal is to focus on real-world projects that are looking to implement blockchain into their current model. This includes fintech, education, environmental, health tech, and more. We are rebuilding our platform (from Terra) to be multichain and build an efficient system to bridge Web2 users to Web3. WeFund believes VeChain aligns with our mission of high-quality projects with real-world applications. WeFund will deliver an alternative launchpad for the VeChain community with safeguards to minimize risks from failed projects through WeFund’s smart contract milestone system The free incubation services will assist in delivering more projects to the VeChain network and community. WeFund is a community and crowdfunding-oriented project. This allows anyone to invest in early projects and explore the VeChain network. This, in turn, would help the VeChain network grow and support high-quality projects.



- We will implement WeChainThor Wallet and the payment with Stablecoin (USDT, VeUSD) 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- https://wefund.app
The MVP is full functioning and deployed on https://wefund.app. We are also developing our smart contracts to work with Solidity (Rust with CosmWasm is completed)
- We have a fully decentralized crowdfunding process with milestone and project backer voting. (managed by smart contracts)
- Main components include: Crowdfunding fundraising, milestone fund release system with voting approval managed by smart contracts, and ability to serve 3 project stages (incubation, fundraising, IDO).

### Ecosystem Fit

VeChain community and projects have limited incubation and launchpad options. WeFund would like to be a primary launchpad option for the VeChain ecosystem.
