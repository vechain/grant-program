## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** VeChain Documentation Bot: "Talk to Your Docs"
- **Brief Description:** A state-of-the-art Discord bot for VeChain, leveraging the latest Large Language Models (LLMs) to allow users to "talk to docs" by querying VeChain's Github repositories, documentation, and related articles.
- **Relationship to VeChain Network:** The bot serves as a bridge between VeChain's existing documentation and its community, offering a streamlined support mechanism within the VeChain ecosystem.
- **Reason for Interest:** Our passion lies in enhancing user experience and engagement within the VeChain network. We see a gap in immediate, efficient support, and our bot aims to bridge this.

### Project Details

- Mock-ups/designs of any UI components: Designs available upon request.
- Data models of the core functionality: Integrating LLMs with VeChain's existing documentation structure.
- API specifications of the core functionality: Using OpenAI's API combined with VeChain's internal APIs.
- An overview of the technology stack to be used: OpenAI, Digital Ocean (Hosting), Supabase.
- Documentation of core components: Available in our GitHub repository.
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work: Prototype bot with limited functionalities available for demonstration.
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide: The bot will not provide real-time human support or handle transactions.
