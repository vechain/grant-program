**Project Overview** 

Project: Alphaday \
Team Name: Alphabox Solutions Pte. Ltd. \
Payment Address: 0x48e239Fa0B364Cd92Fc750A50045c9f9E04DD781 

**Overview**

A brief description of the project: \
Alphaday builds crypto experience dashboards for enthusiasts, developers, and projects. Users can drag and drop from hundreds of services, news and social feeds, charts, and dapp functionality to create their daily workflows inside a single dashboard. This eliminates the need to have multiple browser tabs open to get different bits of information. i.e. imagine having token prices, gas prices, twitter feed, latest news headlines, TVL, borrowing rates and any other information any user could possibly want all within one single dashboard. 

An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem: \
We’ve been followers and fans of VeChain for a long time and its completely decentralized infrastructure resonates with us since we’ve been trying to build and deploy web3 products for the last 5 years. Our product, Alphaday, will aggregate all the information across the VeChain ecosystem into one easy-to-use dashboard so we’re pretty excited to be able to contribute to this ecosystem and its large community.

If relevant, an indication of how you will integrate tools and features (e.g., Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc) to enhance your project: \
Not Applicable.

**Project Details**

Mockups/designs of any UI components: \
You can take a look at our already live Beta version product at https://app.alphaday.com/. \
API specifications of the core functionality: \

An overview of the technology stack to be used: \
Alphaday is a React-Typescript dashboard on the frontend using a Python-Django backend built on distributed infrastructure with Postgres and Redis Databases. \
Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed: \
Please see our Pitch Deck for components, architecture and other information: https://bit.ly/Alphadaydeck. \
PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic: \
We’ve done market research on users and currently people’s regular crypto workflows consist of jumping from one browser tab to another to check prices, read news, follow twitter, participate in discussions . A typical crypto user will have 6 to 10 open tabs at any given time and people have referred to Alphaday as the ‘tab killer’ because all the information you’d need across all your different tabs is available in Alphaday. In this sense, we do not have any direct competitor that can provide 50 different types of services and functionality within one dashboard.

**Ecosystem Fit**

Alphaday has no direct competitors as it aims to recreate a crypto user’s daily workflow (i.e. their general experience) inside a single dashboard. i.e. if a VeChain ecosystem participant wakes up, checks their portfolio, reads twitter, browses the VeChain governance forum, listens to the latest podcast featuring VeChain team members,  does a bit of on-chain research, instead of having this workflow spread across a dozen tabs, it’s all available within a single screen on Alphaday.

Milestone 2  — Maintenance and curation of dashboard and contents:

Maintenance and Curation: 12 months of maintenance including having an Alphaday content analyst quality-checking the dashboard every day and ensuring the Calendar widget is up-to-date with latest VeChain events, all news mentions across the internet are captured by the dashboard, any updates not automatically captured by the Alphaday aggregator engine is manually added to the board, and other maintenance tasks.

Further to the above, we will consistently improve the functionality and availability of features in our application as a whole. Our aim in this is to add value to our application for everyday users within the industry.

Please note that we can add and remove widgets and/or contents as required by your team. For a brief idea about other widgets and data that we can provide, please visit our Live product page (Beta) at: https://app.alphaday.com/

We will also publish the initial deployment of the new VeChain dashboard on all social media platforms.

**Future Plans**

If we get a grant we will start working on the board immediately and we should have it ready within 2 months. Once we’ve launched the board, we will do user interviews and feedback sessions to tune the dashboard. We will continue this process of iterating, deploying, and collecting feedback continuously to build a dashboard that VeChain stakeholders truly love to use.

Are there any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project & have you applied for other grants so far? \
We are in the process of applying for grants to further develop our app and dashboard. We have already been funded and built some dashboards for certain projects (e.g. Impossible Finance, Verasity) and are currently in the process of building more (e.g. Dfinity, Zcash, and around ten more so far).
