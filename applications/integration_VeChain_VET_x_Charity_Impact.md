### Overview

Please provide the following:
- A brief description of the project

Charity Impact provides a multichain platform for individuals and companies to donate to nonprofit organizations (NPO) globally in both cryptocurrencies and fiat. Our goal with this platform is to empower the worldwide charity network through decentralized finance. To date, we have successfully integrated strategies within our platform to allow for donations in fiat and NEAR Protocol. This project seeks to integrate VET into our multichain platform, empowering the charity network within the VeChain ecosystem. Once integrated, every NPO we onboard onto our platform will have a VeChain wallet automatically generated and managed by our back-end system, which will give the organizations the option of downloading their keys. This allows investors to donate directly to the NPOs in VET.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem.

Our CEOs are active participants in the charity network, with a decade’s worth of combined experience in connecting charitable projects with funds. In recent years, our CEOs identified DeFi as a valuable innovative tool that can empower the charity network, through mitigating barriers in the transferring of international capital, protecting charities’ capital from fluctuating currencies in their countries of origin, and potentially allowing charities to earn on their wealth as activity on the VeChain blockchain grows. 

Currently, there are numerous crowdfunding platforms available for fiat currencies or single cryptocurrencies, and very few multichain solutions. This fragmentation forces charities and nonprofit organizations to create campaigns on multiple platforms, leading to inefficiency and impracticality, and hampers investors’ abilities to source charitable projects to which they wish to contribute. By enabling charities to receive contributions in different currencies, Charity Impact expands NPOs’ opportunities for financial support. In order to enhance this multichain offering, we have identified VeChain as a vital roleplayer in the DeFi space. 
- If relevant, an indication of how you will integrate tools and features (e.g., Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc) to enhance your project.

The project will be developed using PHP integrated with Python. We have already tested our concept through the successful integration of NEAR Protocol on our live site. Our team will now use our existing architecture that is currently running our platform to integrate with VeChain.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

We have already tested our concept through the successful integration of NEAR Protocol on our live site. Please find our site integrated with NEAR Protocol here: https://charityimpact.io/ and our code repository here: https://github.com/malcacorp/Charityimpact-Open-source

### Ecosystem Fit
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

The Giving Block is a multichain donations platform through which nonprofit organizations can add donation forms to their websites. While Charity Impact does offer this service to our NPOs, we also allow NPOs to raise funds for specific projects, with custom landing pages and project tracking. The Giving Block has a registration fee of $2 000 USD, inhibiting smaller charities from accessing the platform and thus the DeFi system. Charity Impact allows any charity to join our platform if they are a legally registered entity in their country of origin and we do not have a registration fee. Management of our platform is funded by a 3.8% transaction fee on all donations. All charities will be vetted by our team to verify their legality before their approval is granted and their wallets generated.

## Development Roadmap 

 describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. 
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.


#### Overview

#### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce and publish at least one article/tutorial (e.g., on Medium). It should explain your work done as part of the grant. 

We recommended you provide social medium, like Twitter, Telegram group, or Reddit, on your website. When the developers/users need assistance, they could get in touch with you and get help.

## Future Plans

CharityImpact.io envisions an ambitious and impactful long-term plan to revolutionize the world of charitable giving. Our primary goal is to onboard charities and donors from all corners of the globe, facilitating seamless connections between those in need and those willing to make a difference. We aim to empower charities with efficient fundraising tools and provide donors with a transparent and rewarding giving experience. One of our key objectives is to integrate as many crypto-currencies as possible, allowing for a borderless and secure platform that accommodates the evolving landscape of modern fundraising.

The integration of the VeChain currency will require three months of development work. Once this project is complete, every nonprofit organization we onboard onto our platform will have a VeChain wallet automatically generated and managed by our back-end system. We aim to onboard a minimum of 20 charities onto our platform by the end of 2023, creating 20 new active VeChain wallets. These charities will be identified through our existing charity networks, including the South American Initiative (SAI) (https://www.sai.ngo/) and BeeTogether (https://bee-together.org/),  and leveraging traditional marketing tactics, such as social media campaigns and Google ads. Furthermore, we aim to onboard a minimum of six cryptocurrencies onto our platform before the end of 2023, and to raise a minimum of $50 000 USD through our platform before the end of 2024.

## Additional Information 

Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

In 2022 we were awarded a grant from NEAR Protocol of $50 000 USD. This grant was used to support the founding of the company, set up the development tools needed to develop the website and integration processes, integrate the NEAR currency into the site, develop the website, and cover hosting expenses. This project has been successfully completed.

This project will benefit the VeChain community because:
- Our integration code will be open sourced, to be freely used by other developers.
- Once we launch the platform with multiple blockchains integrated, we will migrate our existing charity network from SAI and BeeTogether to the new platform. With each wallet and transaction generated through our site, we empower the ecosystem of each integrated crypto-currency and add to the value of the coin itself. By running ads we aim to boost the platform and increase its reach, bringing more people into its ecosystem. 
- An integration with our platform provides VeChain with exposure to our social media audience, amplifying visibility and increasing brand recognition.
- Cross-linking with Charity Impact enhances credibility and trust, attracting potential investors and users.
- A blockchain's involvement in social good is beneficial on multiple fronts. Firstly, it enhances their reputation as responsible actors in the digital landscape. By actively contributing to social causes, blockchains demonstrate their commitment to making a positive impact. Secondly, aligning with social good meets the expectations of an increasingly conscious public. People appreciate and support entities that prioritize social welfare. Finally, the collaboration between corporates and blockchains amplifies their collective ability to drive meaningful change in the world. Together, they possess the potential to tackle global challenges and foster a better future for all.
