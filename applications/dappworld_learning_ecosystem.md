## Project Overview

### Project Brief
DApp World is a learning ecosystem for Blockchain technology.
We at core want to provide exceptional educational content favoring fun and interactive learning experience for developers who want to learn and get into Blockchain Space.

We aim to bring millions of developers and help them excel in Blockchain Domain.

Every developer uses various resources for learning which include Video Courses, Practical Courses, Articles, Tutorials, Labs, Competitions, etc.
We provide all that on a single platform with quality curation to favor a fun and interactive experience while learning.

### Contributing to VeChain Ecosystem

Currently, there are very less resources and the present resources are all clouded, unorganized, and dispersed which developers find really hard to learn from.

Even though there are good communities with thousands of members but there is clearly a lack of high-quality resources to help developers learn easily.

With DApp Worldâ€™s contribution, VeChain will have high-quality courses to serve the community to educate and upskill them about building on VeChain in a very fun and interactive way helping developers at every stage of building.

If we provide quality resources, it helps developers to learn easily and will also help the VeChain community by reducing the number of queries from developers while developing dapps.

These wide amounts of resources of different types, produced over time, covering many areas will fulfill the requirements of any developer from a beginner to an expert.

By creating these promised resources focused on VeChain, these can be spread across the different communities including the ones we are building alongside, primarily across India, which over time will accelerate the pace at which developers jumping into the VeChain ecosystem.
