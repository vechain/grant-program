## Summary
This application proposes a scientific initiative with a theoretical contribution on what the VeChain platform really is, by adopting an ontological approach. Ontologies represent concepts and relationships in ways that approximate the way humans perceive interconnected concepts, while promoting machine reasoning on top of that representation to offer insights to users, developers and intelligent applications. In addition to supporting reasoning capability, ontologies provide a coherent and easy interpretation, allowing users to navigate from one concept to another in the ontology structure. The R&D process and contributions will be documented in a scientific paper and an ontology representation. Both will be publicly available on github.

## Research proposal 

### Problem Statement

There is no doubt that the VeChain platform is highly disruptive. However, the lack of a formal definition of its terminology is an open issue since it remains open to interpretation and do not offer a representation for its applications. Currently, VeChain literature is predominantly written either from a purely technical or from an economical perspective. Aiming at supporting the growth of the VeChain community in both formal knowledge and applications, it is critical that users, developers, and investors have a formal and fundamental understanding on how the platform is built and how it works. 

Without such formal representation, application developers may struggle to integrate software components and data, as well as to build querying and reasoning features in a standardized manner. An unstructured development combined with a lack of expressiveness about the ecosystem may jeopardize interoperation and wide adoption of VeChain in heterogeneous socio-technical systems.


### Contributions

An ontology for the VeChain platform will provide important contributions to its ecosystem. One of the main benefits of having an ontology is that it helps to improve the design and implementation of the platform and its applications. By providing a clear and comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental concepts and principles that govern the VeChain platform, an ontology will ultimately support designers and developers to create more robust, secure, and efficient systems.

Furthermore, an ontology for VeChain will promote communication and collaboration between developers, professionals and general users on the platform. By providing a common language for the set of concepts and their relationships, an ontology can be used to assist knowledge construction and consumption, aligning the efforts of different software components, individuals and organizations working symbiotically on the VeChain platform.
ap
Another potential contribution of the proposed ontology is that it can be used to address conceptual issues that may arise in the development and use of the platform. By providing a framework for understanding the core principles and values underlying blockchain technology, the proposed ontology can help identify and address potential conflicts or concerns during component design and conceptualization.

We will provide a format ontology of the VeChain platform. Our initial perspective is that it will be formally specified in Web Ontology Language (OWL), but we may choose another format that we find more suitable during the course of research, e.g. Semantic Web Rule language (SWRL). Then, this ontology can be used for the development of various applications on top of VeChain, e.g. query engines for semantic searching, data integration, dataset builders, data analytics, among others.


### Background

Blockchain ontologies comprehends a growing area of research that aims at applying ontological principles to the field of blockchain and other distributed and decentralized architectures. 

In the context of blockchain, ontology is used to study the fundamental concepts, their relationships, and principles that underlie the technology, with the goal of improving its design, development, and use. One of the key challenges in using ontology to describe blockchain aspects is that the technology is still evolving. This makes it difficult to identify and define the core concepts and principles that govern blockchain systems. Additionally, the decentralized and distributed nature of blockchain technology presents unique challenges in terms of defining and organizing the relevant ontological concepts. Including the definition of consensus algorithms, governance and smart contract specificities, token use, transactions rules, etc.

Researchers have been exploring the potential applications and support of ontology to the field of blockchain and DApps in general. For example, ontology has been used to study the concept of trust in blockchain systems, to develop more robust and secure smart contract systems, and to address potential ethical and philosophical issues in the use of blockchain technology [3, 4].

Currently, VeChain literature is predominantly written either from a purely technical or from an economic perspective. The use of ontologies in blockchain is an emerging field with significant potential for bridging both technical and economic perspectives, advancing the understanding of this technology while improving its design and use. Research is needed to better explore the potential use cases and applications on top of formal ontologies and to develop a comprehensive ontological framework for this type of technology.


### Approach

Our approach will begin by conducting a comprehensive literature review to identify key concepts and principles in ontologies for blockchains. This includes studying the existing applications and ontological frameworks that have been developed for blockchain, as well as other relevant research in the fields of symbolic representation.

Once the key concepts and principles have been identified, the next step is to develop a conceptual framework that incorporates and relates these concepts and principles. This framework will be designed to express the fundamental entities and relationships that govern the VeChain technology, and will be flexible enough to accommodate the ongoing evolution of the technology.

With the conceptual framework specified and developed, the next step will be applying it to a specific VeChain-related use case scenario. This includes conducting case studies to explore the future application of the ontological framework to support building a controlled natural language (CNL) and a querying engine in VeChain’s scalable business blockchain ecosystem.

Another important aspect of creating an ontology is to engage with experts from application domains to gain their insights and perspectives. This engagement helps to ensure that the ontological framework is grounded in real-world experience and reflects the current understanding of representative personas in the applied fields. In this sense, the final step of the proposed approach is to present and discuss the ontology with the VeChain team.


### Risks

The study will be based on ontology construction through conceptual models, and so no particular risks are expected in terms of implementation.


## Milestones

Upon approval, the project will start at an agreed upon date.

Then, these are the proposed milestones 

1. Presentation of the draft of the paper for comments (after 2 months from the start) 
2. Finalization of the paper, according to VeChain team's feedback (after 15 weeks from the start) 
3. Publication of the pdf paper and ontology on GitHub (after 4 months from the start) 


## Budget

The budget requested is US$ 30.000 for two PhDs dedicating about 30 days of work during a 4 months project. Considering that for academic, scientific, consultancy on average a PhD daily rate is about US$500.

We propose to split the payment over three milestones:
1. US$ 14000 at the beginning
2. US$ 8000 upon approval of the first paper draft and ontology draft
3. US$ 8000 upon approval of the final version of the paper and of the VeChain ontology
