# VeChain General Grant Application Template

## Project Overview 

- Project: Thisismagma
- Team Name: MAGMA SAS
- Payment Address: USDC(ERC 20) 0xa7b78cF97B504252ED8097b5754811b43Cce33cc 
- contact email: matthieu@thisismagma.com

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- Magma is an intuitive platform designed to bring agility to the real estate industry. The Magme platform enables real estate stakeholders to create a unique digital asset of a building from a digital twin, which includes all the technical and contractual documentation of the building's objects and elements. This digital asset is called the Digital Twin Token (DTT®).

- We chose VeChain for the Digital Twin Token as this blockchain is based on the Proof of Authority consensus and so requires significantly low gas fees. Vechain's global plans to establish itself as the leader in sustainable and environmentally responsible blockchain solutions joins our approach on building a breakthrough platform for real estate which faces significant ESG challenges. Moreover our CTO jurgen Schouppe has extensive experience on the Vechain blockchain.

- To sum up :

    * Early investors and supporters of Vechain
    * Low Gas fee
    * Fee Delegation technology
    * Faster transaction confirmation times
 
- We will use MPP, ATP and also use the connex compatabible wallet from safehaven Comet to interact with the chain.

    * VIP-180 : MAgma Governannce Token (ERC-20)
    * ERC-1155 : Digital Twin Token
    * ERC-721 : Magma Access Token
    * Comet
    * Connex
    * MPP
    * ATP

### Ecosystem Fit
Other blockchain based real estate projects are globally focused on the sector's liquidity and fractional ownership issues.

Very few projects are really concerned about the environmental impact of the industry and its need of transparency and agility.
 
Magma is revolutionary in the sense that our platform creates an NFT of a building (and child NFT’s of all its components), not only to facilitate ownership, but also to keep an immutable and transparent record of the building's activity.

All the building's elements, objects and documents will be uploaded on Magma and their history will be recorded thanks to blockchain technology.

In addition, we created the Magma Index which evaluate the level of digitization of the building thanks to the data uploaded, but also to measure its environmental performance.
