The MOTODB Protocol

The MOTODB Protocol is a Global, Decentralized Car Industry Blockchain that will enable the Connected Cars Paradigm by putting the Driver at the Centre and Empower them to share their user-generated Data in return for real rewards. We are passionate and strong advocates of Car Data Privacy and also believe that the Driver should benefit from the data they generate. We are working with a wide variety of Car Ecosystem Partners to enable this Vision. The MOTODB Protocol is a Driver-powered Network that aims to decentralize Car Data and deliver benefits to Car Drivers both from a data privacy perspective and monetization benefits. Car data that is accessible on a Public blockchain enables to building of various distributed applications and crypto protocols on top of of this data e.g. decentralized insurance, car finance, prescriptive/ predictive maintenance ML models, decentralized car pooling/ ride sharing and car resale. The MOTODB Protocol consists of Hardware/ Devices called CarMiners, a Driver App and a Decentralized Data marketplace for Cars and vehicles. Our user go-to-market strategy and user-acquisition strategies are based on partnerships with 2 of the top, global companies in the mobility space that are also community-driven. We aim to enable 10 million Cars in the first 2 years with the MOTODB Protocol and enable the collection of Car data in a decentralized, distributed and trustless manner.

The MOTODB Protocol has a working product, the MOTODB CarMiner, the Driver App and a Decentralized Data marketplace built on the NEAR and Ethereum testnets. We are looking to deploy this on the NEO Mainnet. Currently we are at the beginning of User acquisition and will aim to acquire 1 million Car Drivers/ Users over the next one year.

We need US$200k for porting on the NEO Mainnet and US$50k for starting work on the development of the MOTODBDAO. Our milestones are:
Jan-15: Global Launch
Feb-15: Driver App launch
Mar-15: Global shipping of MOTODB CarMiners
Apr-15: Launch of Car Data marketplace

We need and are hiring experienced Blockchain Developers to implement the MOTODB Protocol.
