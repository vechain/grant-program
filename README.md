We DO NOT accept new applications in this repository. However, for projects that have already been accepted in this repository, you can still submit your delivery here.**

## Vechain -EasyA Hackathon Grant Track

Under the Vechain general grant program, a special track has been created for the Vechain-EasyA hackathon attendees to support their follow-up project development. The track will make funds available for 10 projects on a first-come, first served basis. Each project can be funded up to 30,000 USD. 

Visit [Vechain-EasyA-Hackathon-Boston-Oct-2023](./Vechain-EasyA-Hackathon-Boston-Oct-2023) to learn more about it.

## Introduction

The general grant program is designed to fund projects covering a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to,

 - Decentralized applications (e.g., gaming, DeFi, NFT, etc)
 - Tools/libs for testing
 - Tools/libs for frontend development
 - Infrastructures (e.g., explorer, status dashboard, node service, etc)
 - Interoperability
 - Wallet integration
 - Enterprise applications
 - Research projects (e.g., tokenomics, governance, privacy, etc).

Each application can be funded up to **$30,000**. All Applications will be tracked on GitHub and disbursed in USDC.


## Guidelines

In general, your project will have better chances to get accepted if:

- The subject has been **well-studied**, proven by a well-presented intro, including background, prior works, and relevant technical bases.
- Your team has **proven experience** with a relevant and solid technical/research background. For development projects, you should provide the GitHub profiles of your team members as part of your application. A list of your previously done projects will be highly recommended and beneficial. For research projects, CVs of all applicants should be attached.
- Your application is **rich in technical details** and well-defined.
- For development projects, you can demonstrate that the project will be **maintained** after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources, or an existing business model.
- You should point out how your project stands out among competitors (e.g., it implements some technology that does not exist in the ecosystem yet).
- A direct contribution to Vechain's technology and/or ecosystem is a plus.

Additionally, it must fulfill the following requirements:

- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale. However, we do not limit the project's option to do token sales in the future.
- Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or criminal activities in general.

Note that your project will have to follow [Grant Milestone Delivery](/milestone-delivery) to deliver milestones. In particular, we require your team to generate sufficient documentation about each delivery in order to unlock further funding if relevant. Examples, tutorials or videos can be very helpful for us to understand your work and therefore accelerate our evaluation process.

## Application Process

1. **Application Preparation and Submission**
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/vechain/Grant-program) this repository.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template ([`applications/application-template.md`](applications/application-template.md)) or the research template([`applications/research-template.md`](applications/research-template.md)). Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   3. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster its review process will be.
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain _one new file_, that is the Markdown file you created from the template.
   6. Please read the [disclaimer](disclaimer.md) carefully before applying for Vechain General Grant.

2. **Preliminary Review**

   After its submission, an application enters the preliminary review stage where an evaluator will be designated to check whether it is formatted correctly and includes all the requested information. The [evaluator](#grant-evaluators) will label the pull request as "ready for committee review" if the application passes the preliminary review.
   
3. **Committee Review**

   A five-member grant committee will evaluate and make decisions on all the applications passing the preliminary review. The commitee may conditionally accept an application with further requirements for clarifications and amendments. The applicant(s) must _address all the requirements_ via a new pull request. The application will then be accepted once the pull request is approved by one committee member. Final decisions made by the committee will be put on the website to notify applicants and the community. 
 
4. **Milestone Delivery and Payment**

   Milestones are to be delivered on the [Grant Milestone Delivery](./milestone-delivery) folder. You can find the delivery process [here](milestone-delivery#milestone-delivery-process). **Once the application is accepted, the payment for the first milestone will be immediately disbursed to fund the project. The payments of the rest milestones will be disbursed once their previous milestones are delivered and reviewed.**

   The grant application can be amended at any time. However, this _necessitates a reevaluation by the committee_. If your application has been accepted and, during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application.


## Accepted Grant Applications 
 - [Overview of the accepted grants](accepted_grant_applications.md)
 - [Milestone deliveries of the accepted grants](./milestone-delivery/deliveries)


## Grant Committee

For the fund to be best utilized, the grant committee is designed to be as versatile as possible to represent different stakeholders in the vechain ecosystem. Following this principle, the committee is made of a committee chair, a member of Board of the Steering Committee, a member of the Vechain Core Dev, a community project leader and a collective community member consisting of outstanding community contributors.

The community project leader and collective community member will be chosen by our community for each funding round starting from the second round. We will announce the detailed rules and timeline of the whole election process in advance.

The current committee members are:
 - **Committee Co-Chairs:**<br/>
[Peter Zhou](https://twitter.com/PeterZh47977516) - Chief Scientist of Vechain <br/>
