# Vechain-EasyA Hackathon Grant Track
Under the Vechain general grant program, a special track has been created for the Vechain-EasyA hackathon attendees to support their follow-up project development. The track will make funds available for 10 projects on a first-come, first served basis. Each project can be funded up to 30,000 USD. 

## Guidelines

To be eligible for support, applicants must:
- Provide their name as proof of participation in the Vechain-EasyA Hackathon.
- Indicate in their submissions if their project is solving the vechain or BCG track
- Submit a well-structured business plan and a link to the one-pager provided by BCG 
- Demonstrate technical capabilities to deliver project milestones.

## Application Process

1. **Application Preparation and Submission**
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/vechain/Grant-program) this repository.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template ([`Vechain-EasyA-Hackathon-Boston-Oct-2023
/applications/application-template.md`](
applications/application-template.md)). Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   3. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster its review process will be.
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain _one new file_, that is the Markdown file you created from the template.
   6. Please read the [disclaimer](../disclaimer.md) carefully before applying for VeChain General Grant.

2. **Review**

   A special [review panel](#review-panel) will evaluate and make decisions on all the applications. The applicant(s) must _address all the requirements_ via a pull request. Final decisions will be put on the website to notify applicants and the community.

3. **Milestone Delivery and Payment**

   Milestones are to be delivered on the [Grant Milestone Delivery](./milestone-deliveries) folder. You can find the delivery process [here](#milestone-delivery-process). **Once the application is accepted, the payment for the first milestone will be immediately disbursed to fund the project. The payments of the rest milestones will be disbursed once their previous milestones are delivered and reviewed.**

   The grant application can be amended at any time. However, this necessitates a reevaluation. If your application has been accepted and, during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application.

## Milestone Delivery Process

1. **Milestone Delivery:**
   1. In the fork that you used to submit the application, create a copy of the milestone delivery template ([`milestone-deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md`](milestone-deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md)). Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   2. Name the file `project_name-milestone_number.md`.
   3. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone including a **link to the pull request** of your application.
   4. Once you're done, create a pull request.
2. **Milestone Review:**
   1. [Review panel](#review-panel) will review and comment on the pull request. Their feedback needs to be resolved before your milestone is accepted.
   2. Reviewers will merge your pull request to accept the delivery.
3. **Milestone Payment:**
    Payment is made to the ERC 20 address specified in the initial application once the delivery is accepted.

## Review Panel
  Decisions on new applications will be made by a special review panel, composed by:
  - Dr. Peter Zhou (Chief Scientist)
  - Tony Li (Senior blockchain core dev)
  - Antonio Senatore (CTO)
  - Renato Grottola (Head of BD)
  - Dr Bernhard Kroenfellner (BCG, Partner and Associate Director, Digital Assets).
