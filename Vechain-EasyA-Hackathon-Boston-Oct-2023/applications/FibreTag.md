### Technology Stack

* REST API backend running Web3.js/Thorify to interact with smart contracts.
* Solidity tracking smart contract.
* Digital twin NFT smart contract.
* FIAT payment smart contract.
* Vechain.energy API integration as blockchain bridge.
* iOS frontend written in Swift using SwiftUI/UIKit. App is built using MVVM architecture, widely regarded as the one of the best mobile architectures for clearly separating UI and internal logic using internal Xcode target frameworks.
* Basic Web frontend to visualize tracking history.


When a user downloads the app they are presented with several login options - login as a manufacturer scanning and updating tag information or as a consumer wanting to view the history and validate authentication of an item. To allow for an easy onboarding we have a conventional login using Google OAuth which is integrated through Google Firebase, which acts as the server backend for all centralized FibreTag information that does not require the immutability or decentralization of the VechainThor blockchain. Upon successful account creation, certain premium features within the app are locked until activated with a valid API key.

The app provides an easy overview of the FibreTag marketplace, where FibreTag acts as a middle man for users to purchase products from companies that partner with FibreTag. Additionally, users are able to scan the physical NFC tags in the clothing to validate and ensure the validity and origins of their clothing. On top of that, the NFT phygital feature is used to its fullest extent when operated via the iOS app due to the amount of native support Apple provides with its ARKit and RealityKit libraries. Please keep in mind that users can store their private keys for their wallets locally on device using SwiftData und UserDefaults - 2 features Apple provides for device-only information.

Brands and manufacturers submit requests to the backend during manufacturing. After verifying the requests, the API employs Web3.js to interact with the Solidity smart contract. Once processed on-chain, users can request the product history through a getHistory API call.

For a user to purchase an item on the luxury brand’s website the payment provider returns to the website with a specific payment ID and simultaneously informs the backend about a new NFT to be created. The backend, in turn, triggers the vechain.energy-API to mint an NFT corresponding to the purchase ID. As the user waits, the NFT, once created, is sent to their wallet, and they receive a confirmation of the successful transaction.

### Documentation of deployed components
#### User Onboarding
**A Walletless Login with Google OAuth**
* Mobile endpoint: Google Firebase, Web endpoint: /users/walletlessLogin
* User signs in via Google OAuth to allow for a familiar and easy-to-use process
* On successful authentication, Google provides a token which is passed to the backend
* The backend validates this token with Google’s servers, retrieves user details and the associated wallet address
* Users are logged in and presented with their dashboard depending on if they are a worker scanning tags in the manufacturing * process or a consumer validating the authenticity of their product and the supply chain

#### Tracking Luxury Items through the Supply Chain
**Registering a New Item**
* Endpoint: POST /items/register
* Workers or manufacturers can register a new luxury items
* This registers and assigns the NFC tag on the item to a unique ID

**Updating the Item’s Stage in the Supply Chain**
* Endpoint: POST /items/{itemID}/updateStage
* As the item progresses through various stages (e.g. manufacturing, quality check, packaging) the associated NFC tag is scanned using the iOS app.
* Each scan updates the item's stage and records relevant data (like timestamp, location, and worker details).
* This data is logged on the Vechain Thor blockchain

**Checking the Item’s History**
* Endpoint: GET  /items/{itemID}/history
* Anyone can retrieve the complete history of an item using its unique ID.
* For non FibreTag members or workers they can request a paid API key to access this endpoint and validate any items data.
* The history fetched from the VeChain blockchain provides a transparent record of the item's journey.

#### Purchase & NFT Generation
**User Purchases an Item**
* If the user purchases an item from the luxury store, upon successful payment the transaction provides a unique payment ID.

**Minting the NFT Digital Twin**
* Endpoint: POST  /items/generateNFT
* Once the payment is confirmed the backend receives a notification to mint a new NFT.
* The backend interacts with the Vechain Thor blockchain via the vechain.energy-API, instructing it to mint an NFT associated with the payment ID.
* This NFT acts as a digital twin, representing the authenticity and ownership of the physical luxury item.
* Once minted the NFT is sent directly to the user;s wallet associated with their Google account

### PoC/MVP

[https://github.com/nkoorty/Fitag](https://github.com/nkoorty/Fitag)

MVP was submitted for the EasyA x vechain hackathon, however, significant changes will be made to the MVP in terms of expanding on the core functionalities of what was previously known as FiTag. While the general design will be similar, the tracking and verification aspect is going to be the main focus of FibreTag.

## Ecosystem Fit

**IYK (https://iyk.app/)**

IYK is an invite-only platform to provide consumers with “IYK modules” that act as tags that one can attach to physical clothing items in order to create a phygital representation of said clothing item. 

IYK focuses on the consumer of the clothing, hence, while FibreTag heavily focuses on the transparency of the supply chain and how both brands and users alike can increase brand trust and loyalty, respectively.

**DRESSX (https://dressx.com)**

DRESSX is a digital fashion platform where users can purchase and wear digital-only clothing items on their photos or in augmented reality, aiming to provide a sustainable alternative to fast fashion by reducing the physical production of garments.

Unlike FibreTag, DRESSX primarily emphasises the concept of digital fashion and its environmental benefits. FibreTag, on the other hand, offers a comprehensive view of a product's journey through the use of blockchain and NFC technologies, ensuring transparency and combating counterfeits in the luxury fashion market, while also providing the physical item. Furthermore, with FibreTag's unique NFT digital twin system, it not only guarantees the product's authenticity but also promotes unparalleled transparency for both brands and users.
