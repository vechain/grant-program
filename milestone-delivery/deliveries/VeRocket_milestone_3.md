# Milestone Delivery

**The Ethereum address has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](../).**  

* **PR Link:** [https://github.com/vechain/grant-program/pull/42](https://github.com/vechain/grant-program/pull/42)
* **Milestone Number:** M3

We decided to take care of M3 first.

Servers are rented, setup with strong database to support our charts mission. It looks alike Uniswap V2 but with more addtional features, like "personal holdings", "unclaimed VTHO" and dark/light mode.

Hope you enjoy our website. Furthermore, we will continue to improve it, especially mobile mode.
