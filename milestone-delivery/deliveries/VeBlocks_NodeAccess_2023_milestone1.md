# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

* **PR Link:** [https://github.com/vechain/grant-program/pull/6](https://github.com/vechain/grant-program/pull/176)
* **Milestone Number:** 1

Another year has passed and we are in October 2024. With that in mind, the 1st milestone of the Veblocks grand is close to beeing fullfilled: 
Delivering 12 months of free and unrestricted access to the VeChain blockchain (2023-2024).
This includes access to mainnet as well as testnet and a solo-sandbox. 

The nodes were always fast and reliable, updated to the newest vechain-thor software and still are used across the whole vechain-ecosystem.
All steps to the 1st milestone have been accomplished.

With this delivery notice I can hopefully fullfill the trust layed in me by the vechain foundation for the 3nd milestone.

#### Milestone 1 — Uptime, maintenance and improvements for 12 months (2023-2024) ✔️
