# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

* **PR Link:** https://github.com/vechain/grant-program/pull/6
* **Milestone Number:** 3

Another year has passed and July 2023 is approaching. With that in mind, the 3rd milestone of the Veblocks grand is close to beeing fullfilled: 
Delivering 12 months of free and unrestricted access to the VeChain blockchain (2022-2023).
This includes access to mainnet as well as testnet and a solo-sandbox. 

The nodes were always fast and reliable, updated to the newest vechain-thor software and still are used across the whole vechain-ecosystem with even greater reach.
All steps to the 3rd milestone have been accomplished.

With this delivery notice I can hopefully fullfill the trust layed in me by the vechain foundation for the 3nd milestone.

#### Milestone 3 — Uptime, maintenance and improvements for 12 months (2022-2023) ✔️
