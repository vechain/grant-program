# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:


* **PR Link:** https://github.com/vechain/grant-program/pull/6/commits/1694b95e6003a1ebb2e447eaef7d717a139942ba
* **Milestone Number:** 3

Another year has passed and July 2023 is approaching. With that in mind, the 3rd milestone of the Veblocks grand is close to beeing fullfilled: 
Delivering 12 months of free and unrestricted access to the VeChain blockchain (2022-2023).
This includes access to mainnet as well as testnet and a solo-sandbox. 
<br>
The nodes were always fast and reliable, updated to the newest vechain-thor software and still are used across the whole vechain-ecosystem with even greater reach.
All steps to the 3rd milestone have been accomplished.

With this delivery notice I can hopefully fullfill the trust layed in me by the vechain foundation for the 3nd milestone.
<br><br>
I would also like apply for support for a 4th milestone - another 12 months of free access to the veblocks nodes (2023-2024). 
The 4th milestone was not included in the original proposal and will be defined below.

If the application for the 4th milestone is possible, I also request an update of the payment address:
<br>
* from: 0xb8284f68c71c06118dd152884e708e1096ba5c18 USDT (ERC 20) <br>
* to: 0xcb0c81cf6742c2ea97cec01f95c08d22045edbfc USDT (ERC 20)<br>
