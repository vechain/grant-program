# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:


* **PR Link:** https://github.com/vechain/grant-program/pull/6/commits/1694b95e6003a1ebb2e447eaef7d717a139942ba
* **Milestone Number:** 2

With time running like the wind and July 2022 approaching, the 2nd milestone of the Veblocks grand is close to beeing fullfilled: 
Delivering 12 months of free and unrestricted access to the VeChain blockchain.
This includes access to mainnet as well as testnet and a solo-sandbox. 
<br>
At their peak the nodes provided around 150 million requests per day to all the vechain developers and users.
The nodes were always fast and reliable, updated to the newest vechain-thor software and are now used across the whole vechain-ecosystem.

With this delivery notice I can hopefully fullfill the trust layed in me by the vechain foundation for the 2nd milestone and also apply for support for the 3rd milestone - another 12 months of free access to the veblocks nodes.
I also apply for a slight amend of the 3rd milestone. Caused by higher data-center facilitiy cost and more users needing support, I propose a new 3rd milestone as shown below.

All steps to the 2nd milestone have been accomplished.
